Sorry if I sound a bit mad, I took my anti-anxiety medication, but it hasn't helped. Will Israel still be habitable in say 2040 or 2050, how about 2100? I just want some reassurance that things will be okay. That eventually I'll be able to build my life in Israel."

First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

So I am a theist but I do accept modern science and take part in experiments and such for my studies.

People from both sides keep telling me that basically I can't have it both sides. I can't have a slice from both cakes basically.

To keep it short, here are some common examples:

Certain family members keep telling me that I'm a closet atheist for accepting the theory of evolution because the Torah says that mankind and all animals were created as they are now.

Plus the age of the Earth.

While my secular, agnostic and atheist friends keep telling me that I can't genuinely maintain my belief in an old book and some outright think that I'm just pretending to keep my faith to appease my family.

My parents are with me though—they're the ones who raised me to be like this—as well as other family members and friends.

What should I do?"

Except that's very much not true and their actions in other countries prove this. There have been countless incidents in Europe and America where they attack random Jews just because they are Jewish. Again these are citizens of these countries not Israel yet anzionists do it anyway. This is a clear sign that anti-zionism is merely about eradication across the world aka global jihad.

Then there is the protests themselves. Every ""pro-palestine"" protest in America or Europe is about them expecting other countries to do the work for them. They will not go to their middle east and fight instead they sit in non-Muslim countries and try and force them to do their bidding. How ironic for a movement so against colonialism that they try and colonize every single government in other countries. They even have the nerve to wonder why they are not liked by certain political groups in these countries and complain when measures against terrorism or migrant overflow are put in place.

And of course have you ever seen an anti-zionist ever criticize a non-Jewish or non-Christian country? Of course not because that does not fit their narrative. They will never call for an Islamic country to have ""human rights"" because they don't care about human rights as proven by their inhumane treatment of prisoners in the Yom-Kippur war. Antizionists' definition of human rights is simply giving them everything they want and letting them take over any country they want."

Six of them are clear to me as of their meaning: about adultury, murder, eating from a live animal, blasphemy, worshipping other than God or idols, amd stealing. So basically, since Islam teaches these things, and if I follow Islam fully (or at least these parts which are some of the most important laws in Islam), does that mean I am guaranteed a place in 3olam ha-ba?

Also what exactly does it mean to ""establish courts of justice""? how does one go about doing that?"

8,2023-07-01,Names,u/TheAntiConCreeper,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/14nrtc1/names/,"I have a Russian surname. It isn’t a very common one, but it does appear in Tolstoy’s War & Peace and there are a few Russian athletes with the name. My great-grandfather changed it from the very Ukrainian name to “sound” more American, but the way he altered it made it Russian. 

He wasn’t Jewish but his ancestors were Ashkenazi (I know through my DNA testing) and my family research hasn’t identified my last known 100% ethnic Jewish ancestor (about 200 years ago).

I wasn’t raised Jewish, but started converting when I got engaged to my now wife. Her father is Celtic with a very common English name. Her mother is 100% Ashkenazi with a very German sounding name. 

My MIL wanted her to have the English sounding name to conceal her Jewishness so people wouldn’t discriminate against my wife. My wife was raised more secular but now that we are married, is more observant (she was very supportive of starting the conversion process and wanted to be more religious anyway). 

So my wife took my surname upon marriage because the Russian surname “sounds” the most Jewish of them all! 

The funny thing is it works. 

My mother is 100% Italian American and is a basically a living stereotype- it’s kinda surreal. She took my dad’s last name, the very Russian one. People at various jobs in the 30+ years since taking the name have mistaken her as Jewish, often with antisemitic undertones. 

And so, my poor wife had to marry a converting person with a Russian name so people could know she is Jewish and that when we have kids, they will be more easily recognized as Jews."
1,2023-07-01,Today I Failed to Embody Jewish Values of Kindness and Compassion,u/St4RbB0Y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14ns25s/today_i_failed_to_embody_jewish_values_of/,"Shalom to my fellow members of the Jewish community,

I come before you today with a heavy heart, seeking your wisdom, guidance, and your understanding. I write this post as a reminder to myself and as an opportunity for reflection and growth.

Recently, I found myself in a situation that challenged my ability to uphold the values of kindness, compassion, and empathy that are integral to our Jewish faith. Instead of responding with the love and understanding that our tradition teaches us, I let my emotions take control, and I acted in a way that I deeply regret.

In a heated exchange with a colleague, I spoke harshly and disrespectfully, disregarding the principles of shalom bayit (peaceful home) and derech eretz (proper behavior). I failed to treat them with the respect and dignity that every human being deserves.

As Jews, we are called to be a light unto the nations, to be ambassadors of compassion and understanding. Our sacred texts teach us the importance of kindness and the responsibility to pursue justice and righteousness. But in that moment, I failed to live up to those ideals.

I write this post seeking forgiveness from both my colleague and from God. I recognize the impact of my words and actions and the pain they may have caused. I understand that seeking forgiveness is not a simple task; it requires sincere remorse, making amends, and a commitment to change.

I humbly ask for your guidance on how to repair the damage I have caused and how to better align my actions with the teachings of our faith. How can I cultivate a greater sense of compassion and empathy in my interactions with others? How can I strive to be a better representative of our Jewish values in every aspect of my life?

I also ask for your prayers and support as I embark on this journey of growth and self-improvement. Together, let us strive to build a community that exemplifies the values of loving-kindness, justice, and peace, not only in our religious rituals but also in our everyday interactions.

Thank you for your understanding and for being a source of inspiration and guidance. May we all continue to grow in our Jewish identity and become beacons of light in a world that desperately needs it.

After some spiritual experiences connected with AA (I’m in recovery), I realized I believe in God. I was researching religions that best matched my view of god, the afterlife, religions that are LGBTQ+ accepting (I’m a gay woman), etc and Reform Judaism seemed to be the best fit from the internet. I’ve lived out Roman Catholicism, atheism, agnosticism, a Protestant Christian religion, and Buddhism. None of them fit for me or spoke to me as the truth. 

Im going to a service (sorry I don’t know what it’s called officially). I think it’s called a Minyan service (?) just to check out how everything goes. I saw on this synagogue’s website to have a Rabbi help me, so I emailed him (waiting back a response) and I’ll ask people at the service today for more help in that regard. 

However, I want to learn a little more of Reform Judaism on my own time. Do you guys know a website or YouTube channel I can learn more? My issue is there is so much information that I don’t even know where to start looking or how to organize it. I know absolutely no one who is Jewish, so I cannot ask anyone in my personal life about this. There’s so many different names for the services that I don’t even know what each one is about, for example. This religion seems awesome, but I don’t know enough information about it to know if I want to start converting to it 100%.

Also, what do you wear to the services? I was thinking something more formal (best thing I have is a teal glittery dress because I’m homeless and poor and only can carry/afford flannels and work uniforms otherwise right now). I’m sure God would be happy with the best clothes I can reasonably wear given my circumstances, but I don’t want to be disrespectful either. Any input is appreciated. 

Thank you in advance to any information. I just literally know almost nothing about Judaism other then basics beliefs in god, views of the afterlife, that Reform Judaism is LGBTQ+ accepting, and that Judaism generally doesn’t believe in Jesus Christ as the son of god (something I’m very firm about in my beliefs having Roman Catholicism shoved down my throat growing up). The vibe I get from the synagogue’s website is you guys are e generally loving and accepting (not a fake accepting like what I grew up with). That’s one of the main things that attracted me to go to a service today. 

Thank you! :)"

I feel like I don’t know where I belong at all. My mother is Mizrahi Jewish (Syrian grandfather Tunisian/Moroccan grandmother) and my father is not Jewish and white. My build has some conventional Mizrahi features but my colours are more conventionally western, I.e pale skin, blue eyes and brown hair. 

I don’t live in Israel or in a Jewish community at all. I’m on of the very very few Israelis/Jews that live where I do. And most of the time where I live in just a Jew. That’s all I’m known as: “The Jew”. I hate it. I know that as close as I am to my friends where I live I know that there will always be a divide because I’m Jewish and I won’t get treated the same. But when I go to israel for instance Im hardly regarded as a Jew and to them in just a white man even though I’m half white i just appear white. 

In conclusion to the non Jews all I am is a Jew and to the Jews I’m not one of them. I don’t think there’s much I can do about this but I hope things get better when I move to israel next year."

I’m planning to visit Palestine with a friend for the first time in August for a week. My idea is to book a staying in Jeruzalem and from there make a few day trips to Ramallah, Nablus, Bethlehem and/or Hebron. Therefore, I had a couple questions:

1. What is a reasonable good hotel/hostel in (East) Jeruzalem? For me it’s important that it is Palestinian owned and close to the old city / Aqsa.
2. Since I’d like to visit some other neighboring cities as well (i.e. Ramallah, Nablus, Bethlehem and/or Hebron) I was wondering if it would be a good idea to stay over in Jeruzalem for the entire week and make day trips to these cities or to book a stay over at these places for a night?
3. Also, what cities would you recommend most if I don’t have much time. 
4. What is the best way to travel around? Bus or taxi?
5. Do you recommend any specific tours or guides to visit the area?

I’d be happy to hear your advice/suggestions!"

As part of my continued quest to incorporate more observant aspects into my life, I've been interested in using a tallit during shacharit (my Ashkenazi Reform shul is much more liberal on the practice of only wearing it after marriage). 

While looking for one to use, the most commonly suggested place to purchase one seems to be 'Ben's Tallit Shop', from which I've heard plenty of very good reviews. But I'm very unfamiliar with some of the customs of tallit and which styles symbolise or signify differing practices, and so I was looking for some guidance on this front. Do black/blue/white strips hold a particular meaning? I'm fairly familiar with tzitzit customs but for the tallit itself I'm not sure if there is anything I should be particularly mindful of.

Now, due to personal circumstances, they are seeking to potentially relocate back to Israel.

I am therefore wondering (as my family member is now 70+ years old) if Israel has some kind of military or veteran pension? or another type of pension that they would be eligible for?

On one hand I understand being jewish is more than just keeping 613 commandments, but I still believe in God (or at least the idea of one), and I like all of the Orthodox traditions that I was raised upon, but I was told numerous times that I can't be Orthodox and still think like that, But Reform and Conservative don't really speak to me...

- Rachel Adler, ""Engendering Judaism"". (1998, p. 114). 

I've been reading Engendering Judaism, which is a ground-breaking Jewish feminist theology from 25 years ago, and I came across this quote that jumped out as me. As a Reform Jew I appreciate this description. I think we liberal/progressive Jews tend to see Torah as both a human document AND holy. Both the product of a given time & place AND relevant in our time & place. The project of liberal Judaism is to reconcile these two ideas in constructing a Jewish practice.

443,2023-07-02,Closed cafeteria at a public hospital in Tel Aviv on a Saturday: Shabbat laws in Israel have gone too far.,u/Aleph_Price_Action,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/14oi2hy/closed_cafeteria_at_a_public_hospital_in_tel_aviv/,"Let me preface this by saying that I respect Shabbat and anyone's desire to practice it. I'm also not opposed to private businesses making individual decisions about whether they're going to stay open on Shabbat.

However, in my opinion, certain essential services have to stay open on Shabbat. I'm in Israel taking care of my dad after he suffered from a stroke and almost passed away. He's now disabled, bed-ridden, and shits in a diaper. I'm at the hospital every single day with him from 9 AM until 9 PM, and as his caretaker, I need to eat. I need to fuel my body, so I can help my dad.

So, if Shas cares about pikuach nefesh, they should make sure that the cafeteria and stores at Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv are open on Saturday, so that people like me can take care of their parents. Yesterday, I had to order Wolt delivery to the hospital, and I just couldn't believe that things in Israel got to the point to where I need to order food delivery to a hospital in order to just eat and take care of my disabled dad. It's honestly mind boggling and disgusting, and it doesn't represent the Judaism that I believe in.

Everything food related at the hospital was closed on Saturday:

P.S. If your argument is that I could have just cooked and brought food to the hospital, I'm sorry, that's not fair. I'm in an Airbnb without a proper kitchen, and not everyone visiting family at hospitals in Israel lives in Israel. 

Cafeterias at hospitals are an **essential service**. They need to stay open on Shabbat. This is crazy."

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jm7965i1gi9b1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e23be85344c0eac63b7db6221d602c6f8577ea4e

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

When we consider the distribution of resources, power, and benefits in society, two contradictory principles drive the various proposals.

One direction is the desire to be fair and equal in the distribution, thus giving all individuals within society the motivation to participate in it.

The opposing viewpoint assumes that in order to adapt, innovate, and grow, creative and ambitious individuals within that society must be given special incentives in the form of an increased allocation of resources, power, and benefits. In other words, if you can't become much wealthier than everybody else, then you'll just hang back and ride on the efforts of others.

The argument for radical inequality in the distribution of wealth proposes that even the poorest member of society is better off under a system that incentivizes a few outstanding individuals to make the society as a whole prosper.

The need for incentive seems to be a hard fact of human nature. The alternative, where society legislates that everybody must work hard without providing incentives, requires high levels of coercion, mostly at gunpoint. Various Communist regimes ended up murdering tens of millions of their own citizens before they realized that it couldn't be done.

The modern solution is to tax income at progressively higher percentages as income increases but then to drop that percentage for the highest income brackets. At the other end of the scale, for the poorest, the alternatives are to work hard or face dire poverty and privation. This system was already adopted in Europe in the late Middle Ages when food productivity started rising and populations started growing. Instead of working fewer hours per person, farmers still worked the entire day and the rest faced the problem of finding jobs off the farm. This reached an extreme today where almost none of us work to produce the basic needs of living, yet many of us still have to work hard every day.

Income probably cannot be taxed any further without risking more tax evasion and killing the incentive to work hard, innovate, and take the risks needed to keep growing the economy and help science and technology progress.

Society is still faced with the same dilemma of how to balance the need for equality and fairness, with incentive and growth.

One radical proposal, that nobody can imagine trying, is to reset wealth distribution once every few years, say once per generation or two. At every reset, all the wealth of society would be redistributed, so that everybody has exactly the same share of everything. Immediately after the reset, everybody can go back to striving to accumulate as much wealth as possible. This would prevent ever-rising inequality while still always providing the incentive of trying to get rich.

Assuming that a hard reset is impractical due to the severe shock of such a sudden change, perhaps a gentler alternative is continuous resetting. Instead of a radical redistribution once in a while, wealth, but not income, would always be taxed. As an outstanding individual succeeds in causing the flow of wealth to move ""uphill"" towards themselves, there would always be a force that pulls the wealth back ""downhill"". If an individual or family stops providing society with the benefit of growth, a slow and gradual process will eventually redistribute the concentration of wealth at that location.

Of course, this idea would never work. Why on Earth would the rich and powerful agree to such a scheme?"

It's probably the only country where I've encountered such a bad attitude of people towards foreigners and the amount of scam attempts.

For example - while in Jerusalem, an elderly Jew grabbed my hand, started tying a red string around my wrist, then talked about blessings, and finally whether I would give him some money. I refused and walked away. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed that he called out to some other guy, pointed at me, and then this guy came up as if nothing ever happened and asked if I wanted a nice view of the west wall..... Only it would cost 70 shekels xD I agreed, but I didn't have the money, so I dragged him around the ATMs in the area until I finally told him to get out.

...Muslims were having Ramadan at the time and some nice Muslim gentleman handed me a bottle of water for free. Nice.

At the airport also showed a picture of what it looks like. Selection in line: who better (? depending on passport surei) goes earlier, who worse stands in line.... manned by \*one\* person who thoroughly checks everything for 20 minutes.  Cabaret not airport xD

I understand the Holocaust and the problem with the existence of one's own country, but just because something like that happened doesn't mean you should act like an asshole, which is what you are doing. Spiteful to the whole world.

In any case, the memes and myths about Jews are true after all. I don't farewell and I don't invite discussion. (And my cometnary is not racism or a manifestation of xenophobia. It's an opinion with which you may or may not agree. )"

With that though  I was hoping someone could answer the question, WHO IS CHAIMO. I’ve been seeing nothing but his status on YouTube and since I don’t know any Yiddish (and very little Hebrew) I was just wondering who this guy was.

I (bride) am reformed and planning my wedding for next May. I am having a hard time wanting to make sure my relatives who are Modern Orthodox feel comfortable. The food is no issue. We found a caterer that is their level of Kosher. 

The problem is the wedding dress. I have an overheating problem where I sweat a lot (likely thyroid related) and normally if i wear a t shirt and shorts in the summer i will sweat indoors. So I want to get a long sleeveless dress so I don't look gross or smell but i feel disrespectful to my orthodox relatives who will be attending. They have told me they know it will be a reformed wedding and still want to attend but idk how to go about the dress.

 Those who are modern orthodox, should I try to at least get a dress with some sleeves/shoulders covered and be uncomfortable to be respectful or wear a small sleeved dress with my shoulders uncovered and not sweat as much? The ceremony will be outside in May and usually the weather is around 80 degrees Fahrenheit (could even be closer to 90) but the reception will be indoors.

Usually if we visit them or they visit us on vacation I will wear a sleeved shirt either down to the elbows or close to the elbows and a skirt or Jeans to be respectful. So I am at a loss.
Thank you for helping!"

Every time it’s been an utter PITA to find out where to go that’s Jewish in a given area.

My first go to would be Google, and often I’d find Chabad or defunct websites. Then I’d go on either this subreddit or r/Judaism and get posters annoyed by my ‘pedantic’ question. Sometimes the thread has one poster give a good tibit.

I got lucky in my most recent move to Chicago, as I found Chitribe accidentally which has all the events in Chicago amalgamated.

Now that I’m moving back to NYC (both for a new job and also to intentionally meet more Jewish singles) I’m trying to find out similar information: what are the happening YJP groups? It’s been 6 years since I lived in NYC.

Some of them still exist (MJE being the largest) but who knows if it’s still very active. Some of them no longer do. There’s probably more and new ones I have no idea about. I’ve heard there’s WhatsApp groups and similar nowadays but I have no idea how to find out about those and where they exist.

I guess where I’m going with this is; would it be useful for the community to have a sticky page that contains the various YJP groups in a given location (and possibly even who it targets)? It’s very intimidating every single time to try and find the low down, especially if you’re preparing before actually moving and trying to figure out where to move.

For example: if I knew Lakeview was the YJP hub I would have moved there instead of where I did…maybe I would have been more integrated with the community. Maybe not. Either way it would have been a lot more useful to have known **before** relocating than after, if that makes sense.

I don’t want to be annoying with my question, and I’ve seen others ask similar questions in this subreddit get similar treatment. I think having a sticky thread that has an FAQ that gets community updates and support (or maybe a wiki page) would prevent assholes like me making annoying posts :)

Another idea: maybe having a community liaison from a big city that can be utilized to ask questions and get details that’s may be a bit harder to get from a faq (such as where to move, culture, etc)?"

Based on her heritage, though, I don’t think any of main US Jewish movements would consider her “officially” Jewish—she has a secular Jewish father and a Christian mother and she was raised as a practicing Christian, with only a vague knowledge of Judaism. She wouldn’t be considered Jewish due to her solely patrilineal heritage by the Conservative and Orthodox movements and wouldn’t meet the Reform requirements of being patrilineal and raised exclusively as Jewish, especially because she was actively raised as a practicing Christian. On the other hand, it seems very harsh to say to someone who’s experienced antisemitism and is now so excited about being Jewish, “yeah, you’ll actually still need to convert, but we’re so glad to have you.” So, it kind of raises the question of how to welcome and embrace people of Jewish ancestry while staying true to accepted definitions of Jewishness without seeming really gatekeep-y and invalidating.

What is Conservative Halacha regarding vows and oaths?,u/Flash_Flex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14ozrjg/are_there_any_conservative_rabbis_on_this/,"According to Orthodox Judaism, merely saying ""I will do..."" or ""I will not do..."" may qualify as an oath. Yet, nullifying a vow or an oath is extremely difficult (may even be next to impossible, depending on a content).

Is Conservative Judaism similar in this regard? I am asking because I could not find any Conservative source about vows or oaths. Also, I cannot find the Conservative rabbi to discuss it. In particular, I'm interested what does Conservative Judaism have to say about the following:

1. Does saying ""I will do..."" or ""I will not do..."" qualify as an oath?
2. What is the exact wording of a vow and an oath, according to Conservative Halacha?
3. Does making a vow or an oath in a dream count as making an actual vow or an oath?  If so, would it require a panel of ten men to nullify it?
4. I think I may suffer from OCD. Sometimes, I find myself talking to myself without even noticing it. I might have accidentally make an oath or even a vow recently but I cannot remember for sure. Would it still count as making a valid oath or a vow according to Conservative Halacha? Would I require to nullify it?
5. Is there a law in Conservative Judaism that doing a deed three consecutive times in a row regarded as a vow? If so, how to get released from it?
6. Does thinking about giving charity count as an actual vow in Conservative Judaism as well?
7. Would Kol Nidrei nullify any vows and oaths? If yes, does it apply to both past and future vows and oaths?"

She moved on from casual anti semitism to outright denouncing the covenant as racist/supremacist. She finally asked me (more demanded) my opinion which I wasn’t circuitous about, I told her boldly to her face “the covenant between Israel and HaShem never changed, the people around them recontextualized our religion to suit their geopolitical and cultural purposes, but if you think I reject the covenant, you’re dead wrong. I believe the Jewish people have a special relationship to G-d, that doesn’t mean other humans can’t be holy or have a divine connection, or that G-d didn’t create all humanity”. Welp I got denounced as a racist and “Jewish supremacist”. 

I’m pretty solid in my ego/sense of self and took the whole thing in stride (she is no longer my friend), but how should I respond in future? I don’t like using language that avoids the question to satiate other people’s  worldview. That said I’m not trying to antagonize gentiles and make Jews look bad or be targets of violence.

Edit: Just as a head’s up, I make it a point to not discuss politics/religion with anyone anymore barring family and close friends.

I’ve had a long history of mental health struggles and found myself in a dark place again last night. 
So I had taken an overdose and was lying in bed waiting for it to kick in. I felt myself pulled out of my body in a way and towards a light (ik that’s so cliche but I promise that’s exactly how it felt). As I was trying to move towards the light I heard the voice of God. He told me that it wasn’t my time to die and I should not end my own life. He urged me to reconnect with my families past and roots and seek guidance in Judaism.

I’m really not sure where to start or who to talk to about the religion as none of my close family practice. Any help would be much appreciated!

If any of the mods don’t want this question here, please let me know and I will delete it!  

There’s a guy that works at convenience store by my house. I get gas there all the time. He always says lewd things to me like “When are you going to tell me where you live so I can f—k you” and “You should show off your body more.” (Because I’m tznius). I usually tell him something like “There are cameras all around here, aren’t you afraid of getting fired?” He straight-up says “I don’t give a f—k.” When he’s asked me what I’m doing at [whatever time he gets off], I tell him that I’ll be at home with my pit bull (I don’t have one, but he doesn’t know that). He says something along these lines to me every time I go in there when he’s working for at least the past two months.  

Anyway, tonight he told me “I was going to shave off my beard and my hair, but then I realized I look like Jesus.” He took off his baseball cap and shook out his hair. Does he think I was going to fall all over him because he has longer hair? Really? I said “I’m Jewish, you can keep your Jesus.” The other customer in line behind me laughed, but “Jesus” glared at me.  

I’m kind of wondering if I should say something to the store manager. Or if I should just quit going to that convenience store? The next closest gas station is a few exits up the freeway and then down the road from the exit. It’s inconvenient when I’m on my way to work or coming home from work, whereas this gas station is just down the street from my house. Do you think my last comment will be enough for him to quit bothering me?

1,2023-07-03,Why Israel is winning,u/c9joe,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/14pbkbz/why_israel_is_winning/,"Personally I don't think the Israel-Palestine conflict really defines Israel. Outside of the Internet I barely hear about it. But in any case, Israel is winning.

One reason I think Israel has a good future is if you look at America their history is very similar to Israel. So there is a good chance Israel will become a new America over the centuries. Here are some of the reasons. 

#### Jews are an excellent national substrate 

Jewish people are very good, high quality people on average. They produce low levels of petty and violent crime, have strong family values, seemingly more resistant to social and chemical addictions. They produce a large number of highly intelligent people. They are non-homogenous and have a diversity of viewpoints, skills and abilities which is important at a national level. 

They are deeply loyal to their peoplehood and identity, to the point that there is a huge number of ""atheist Jews"". Jews are willing to disbelieve in God but they are not willing to assimilate to non-Jewish identities. I think this is because the Jewish identity is a powerful and heroic identity.

Israel is probably the most pro-immigrant country in the world (pro the immigration laws of the country). I think this is because Jews are fond of other Jews and see them as valuable people.

#### Haredim are not a major problem

Hating the Haredim is the favorite of Reddit. I contend that actually Haredim are not a big problem. While it is true they have less labor participation, they also live very frugally. That means their economic impact is minimal. While it is true they participate less in the IDF, there is a lot of diffusion between Haredi and Dati Leumi and Dati Leumi are great soldiers. 

Some personal anecdotes but former Haredi are some of the best coworkers I've ever had. I don't mean as being pleasant people, they are, but they are also really smart and competent. I don't really know how this is possible, but apparently they learn nothing of value in school. But probably people are too dismissive of the value of a yeshiva education. 

I've been to yeshiva (Jewish religious school) for a little bit, and I think what it is mostly is a way to learn how to learn. It is also a way to learn why to learn, which I think is sometimes missing in secular education. It's all encompassing, the Talmud is really everything about everything, it was an early attempt by Jews to try to know everything about everything. Obviously it's from a pre-science time, but it's still very comprehensive and thoughtful. Yeshiva study is also really intense, while Hiloni are playing video games or going to the beach, Haredim are still studying. 

#### The protests show Israelis of all kinds care a lot about the country

If you look at the protests and counter protests, they are basically themed around who is the most loyal to Israel. If you look at protests at other countries, they seem to be far more aggressive against the country itself. You don't see the protesters in France waving French flags for example.

For what it's worth the government is also far more polite to protestors then they are to protestors in other countries.

#### Arabs are more flexible then implied, fond of Israeli culture, and absent the conflict highly interested in collaboration 

It only took 13 years from the Arab League's Khartoum Resolution ""no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it"" for Egypt, the biggest Arab country, to sign a peace treaty with Israel. Egypt flips governments often, and is a rather unstable country, but they seem to religiously stick to the terms of this peace treaty. 

You have Jordan sign a peace treaty asking for very little from Israel in return. You then have UAE and Morocco doing similar. As far as I can tell a big reason UAE signed a peace treaty is primarily because they are fond of Israel (at least the government). I don't mean they are fond of how Israel treats Palestinians, but the general ""startup nation"" culture. 

Further Israel is 20% Arab. These are the Arabs inside, they are everywhere even in Tel Aviv. They treat Israeli Jews with more respect than French Arabs treat French, IMO. I think part of this is simply that Jewish and Arab culture, or Jewish and Arab people are simply more compatible. There is a culture clash, but I don't think it's as extreme as the European-Arab culture clash. 

#### Israel has no real peer competitors in the region

Israel is a highly progressive country (in the classical sense of progress) and no Middle Eastern country really compares. I would say UAE and Iran are the closest but it's still not at the same level.

#### Israel might not have any peer competitors in the world

The real peer competitors to Israel are the European countries and America, basically the West. The West is highly progressive and most science and tech advancement comes from there. But the West is in a decline. For example they have a low birthrate and low sense of unity or patriotism compared to Israel. This means that Israel's share of excellence in human progress seems to be noticeably larger over time.

#### God?

Modern Israel seems to fulfill a lot of prophetic visions so I am not so easily dismissive of this. I'm not very religious, but I think there might be merit in this idea that the ancients knew things about how the world really worked that we might have lost. 

The ancient Jews had a lot of similar characteristics to modern Jews and I think perhaps they knew things that we did not, that was lost due to all the upheavals in Jewish history. So maybe the story of the Tanak is not the whole story, but I think there is something there. But in general Tanak (the Bible) is a national treasure and should be treated that way. A general respect of it, not necessarily a stubborn adherence, I think is a source of a lot of Israel's power."

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

Human beings are a species of animal on the one hand, but they are very special in many ways on the other. However, even seen as an animal, they are quite extreme in respect to the fact that they cannot survive alone; they need the support of a group or the facilities that they create in order to survive.

There always exists, therefore, a tension between self-interest and the need for individuality on the one hand and the needs of the collective on the other. We need the help, cooperation, and protection of others, but we want to be left alone to follow our own vision, for people not to take what is ours or restrict our freedom.

Our most intense debates often center around assumptions about private property.

One view is that the property that we own and our creations belong to us as an absolute right. We might choose to allow some of these to be given away in return for the fulfillment of our social needs, but our property always starts off as absolutely ours. Without our permission, even though it may be only implicit, society may not take anything from us, since it is always ours.

The opposing view is that ownership is a concept that the group creates. There is no meaning to the idea of ownership except as a rule in a cooperative game that we all play. In the interests of the efficient functioning of the group as well as an investment in its future, the group allocates all resources as it sees fit. If the group decides that some of the resources are for you to benefit from, for now, we call that ownership. Society is fully entitled to reallocate these resources as it benefits all of us collectively."

The documentary is freely available to watch on Youtube: [https://youtu.be/ZaovE-TtuHU](https://youtu.be/ZaovE-TtuHU).

For ""Sheindi's Diary,"" Peter Hell and Christin Wahl traveled to the original locations: Galanta, Érsekújvár, Auschwitz, Peterswaldau, and finally to Jerusalem, where Sheindi Miller-Ehrenwald has been living since 1949. Here, she gave the authors her interview and read from the original recordings herself.

The story of Sheindi Miller-Ehrenwald in ""Sheindi's Diary"" is narrated by and voiced by actors Iris Berben, Christian Berkel, and Lea van Acken. The technique of ""Live Painting"" was used to visualize historical events, resulting in a seamless reconstruction of the diary entries."

Thought we do not all believe it, this land is still our right as a nation, since our ancestors lived there hundreds and thousands of years ago. Although many of us are converts from other nations, we are still one nation, and they are still entitled to this land, since our ancestors lived there.

As a people like other peoples, we have the right to self-determination (it is called Crossism), and we choose to live on this land that is rightfully ours, to build there a homeland for our nation, under the Christian state of Jesustate that is for Christians and only for Christians but is still democratic. Non-Christians will be ethnically cleansed and forbidden from returning, as per our right to self-determination.

2,2023-07-03,The culture of cancellation and silencing,u/pinchasthegris,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/14pcqoc/the_culture_of_cancellation_and_silencing/,"there is a term used by left wing ideologies of cancelation and silencing. it comes from the Marxists. like Herbert Marcuse. that called for his students in the 60's to make there doubters mouth shut up.

this ""cancelation culture"" of not listening to the other side. and wanting that only the opposite ideology to yours will be tolerant to you. with you not tolerating it. has been used a lot by left wing ideologies. and sadly. also Palestinians and pro-Palestinians

I think that this is the reason there are not a lot pro-Palestinians in this sub. because they will rather say ""they are bad"" when no one can disagree with them. instead of sitting down and trying to fined a solution with this problem. something the Israelis agree to do for years now.

I think this is why the Israeli side is the right one, because instead of sitting and saying how bad and wrong the other side of the spectrum is. the Israelis try to fined a solution to this issue. with organizations like Shalom-Achshav and the current opposition in the government being against settlers and trying to help Palestinians, like the new elevator built in the Tomb of the Patriarchs for Palestinians that can't go up stairs. also, the high court of Israel deciding to destroy homes of settlers if a Palestinian can clame that he owned the land before them.

so who is the better side? the one that just says that the other side is bad. or the one that actively tries to help the other and fined a solution to the Israel-Palestine problem"

I am not here to cause trouble or have internet beef, just would like an academic discussion regarding this issue.

The Israel/Palestine issue has been the most consistent headline in the UK ever since I could remember. Every year no matter what, you can guarantee that there will be a major news story from the region and people dying.

I suppose my question to you guys is this, how do you see this ending?

I don't see Israelis going anywhere or having a change of heart. I don't see Palestinians going anywhere or having a change of heart. You often hear about a 2 state solution but I don't think that's going to happen. I used to think that if the US somehow decided to stop being an ally to the country, Israel could potentially fall if the Arab world came together but this isn't happening anytime soon. I think Israel has reached to the point where it could sustain itself without foreign allies to be honest (in the military sense) and the idea of the Arab world coming together to unify over this one issue is again highly improbable at this stage.

Is this the world's never ending ""conflict""? Will my grandkids be reading about the same cyclical bloodshed?

It's probably impossible to be predict but I'd like to hear from your side of things, and I'm genuinely curious as to how Israelis feel about it.

Thanks"

I am an Arab student living in Germany who studied politics. Since May 2021, as we know was the peak of Israeli oppression and murder in recent years, I took a page from their book and went on the offensive. I started talking to everyone I know about it, really shaming people who support Israel, telling the facts and the history, the massacres in 48, and the ethnic cleansing going on. I was using the biggest words I knew to make people uncomfortable with even the idea of having an Israeli friend.

I must've shared 5 to 10 stories on my IG every day for months. I still share but not as frequently. The feedback was great, I have managed to turn all but one, into Palestine supporters, and to acknowledge that it shouldn't have existed on stolen lands.

During that time, I was working as a care assistant for a private employer. The topic was opened and he was on the other side of it, ""oh but there are children hiding in bunkers, and my friend just moved there and what did they do deserve this?"". I, in turn, went HAM, asking him whose house did his friend steal? And his friend and child shouldn't have been to fucking start with, and I continued my usual speech to the point that I was adamant not to let this conversation end with him thinking he was 1% right even if it meant losing my job. Well I didn't lose my job, and I don't think his brain quite understood the magnitude of what I'm saying when I mentioned the robbed houses and the massacres. 

So, after three years of working for him, tomorrow is my last day, and I am genuinely thinking of buying him an audiobook, ""The Idea of Israel"", I remember this book's intro was so hard to read, that's why I thought it would shock his senses right away into seeing the ugly truth. The thing is, he can't really read well for extended periods of time, so he does audiobooks, and as I was testing the waters yesterday, he told me he hasn't played any audiobooks for some time since he was very busy with work.  


So what do you think? Should I get him the book, knowing there is less than a 50 percent chance he'd actually read it, but at least I did my best? Or be a proper European and save my money?"

as i said in the title, i’m hispanic and latino (chicano to be more specific i.e mexican american). but i’ve noticed that when it comes to antisemitism, there are some similarities that i can see and compare with the racism i’ve dealt with growing up. 

now i want to preface, i’m not trying to make it a competition in terms of who has it worse, hispanics or jews. but rather i’m trying to explain the similarities in the discrimination we deal with as different groups. and create a discussion because i feel like hispanics and jews share a lot in common.

one thing that i’ve noticed is said a lot about jews is how they “have it easier” than others and “take jobs and opportunities from others”. this sounds very similarly to rhetoric i’ve heard be hurled at hispanics, especially hispanic immigrants. being that i’m the son of an immigrant, my dad always made an effort to teach me about mexican culture, even when i felt a lot of the times i was kind of forced to assimilate in a way.

i feel jews face this problem as well, and i sympathize because i know how it feels to have to hide your culture. wether to be accepted or for your safety. especially with the rise of antisemitism and hispanophobia in recent years. especially during 2020-2021 to now. 

but what are y’all’s thoughts? do you agree or disagree? id love to further this discussion with y’all."

I was raised reform and my father is Jewish while my mother isn’t. It was never an issue in my synagogue especially given the fact that I was raised by a single father. 

However I went on birthright recently and was making conversation with other attendees, including IDF soldiers, and a couple of the girls there also were from Jewish dads, and we related. 

The IDF soldiers got annoyed, telling us that we weren’t jews, we had no business being on birthright, and that were not like them. 

Is the hostility towards patrilineal Jews something common in Israel, or was this just a couple individuals? I have people in my dads family who have rejected me for the same reason, but is this a more prevalent thing in Israel? 

I don’t mean to stereotype or offend anyone! Simply wondering

We have a very large menorah that will be lit for each night of Hanukkah. But we will also have some smaller menorahs throughout the display. Would it be considered insensitive/offensive to have those smaller menorahs have all 9 lights lit throughout the winter season (typically late November until New Year’s Day) that the display will be up? I’d hate for our attempt at inclusion to be taken the wrong way just because we don’t know too much about the etiquette of the ceremony.

It's one thing to argue from emotion, it's quite another to argue from a position of rationality.

I've always used the organization B'tselem to provide statistics on the conflict.  They're the ones that are supposed to keep track, and I appreciate the fact that it's based on liberal-left two state values.  However, it seems as though they've increasingly made their statistics opaque.  I used to be able to check on fatalities per year, but that's been hidden behind an increasingly difficult to navigate series of menus and web pages.

For example, I can't quite find statistics per year, but I can find ""Since Operation Cast Lead.""  Which aggregates all of the data since that conflict into one bar chart.  However, if I go to look at home evictions, that data is readily available by year.

Am I crazy, or is this data being purposely obscured by B'tselem?  Tell me if I sound crazy, but I think it's because annual death count is remarkably low, and it's difficult to make arguments about genocide or apartheid when you actually look at what the numbers are.  This allows them to continue to make qualitative arguments and downplay their quantitative work.

But this sounds like a bit of conspiracy theory, and before I believe this more concretely I'd love this idea to either be pushed back on or confirmed by other people."

I researched Jewish prayers for that and found this one, it says that you’re supposed to do it when you wake up, to start off your day with the right foot, but decided to say it nonetheless, first I heard someone saying it with English lyrics and later on I said it myself in Hebrew (I don’t speak a world of Hebrew but there was a pronunciation guide with audio so I repeated each word very carefully and tried to imitate the sound of each word correctly) 

Now I feel like my anxiety is long gone, and now i have a more clearer and calmer state of mind to think about my next actions better, so thanks for that"

I think sesame street did a very beautiful thing in portraying the ""other"" as fundamentally good individuals. Bert and Ernie are an obvious analogue for a gay couple, big bird lives in a makeshift house in an alley, and oscar is a grouchy person that lives in a trash can.

I was discussing this with my friend and brought up the count being an analogue for a jewish person. He has an accent, wears mostly black clothing, and dances to clarinet music.

She thinks im being antiemetic.

Am I wrong for thinking things like the count and the addams family (to a lesser degree) are portrayals of ""other"" (specifically jewish) groups?  
Am I wrong in thinking that these characters being portrayed as ""other"" while fundamentally being good people is a good thing?

I have left Israel and encountered a pretty bizarre situation. The security singled me out and went through all my stuff (asked me to unpack, went through a ton of questions, which I understand is normal). Funny thing is, they mentioned that I can’t travel with my laptop on the same flight, and that they will ship the laptop on the next flight to my address which I provided. Would the laptop arrive on time and normally? Do they install bugs or clone my laptop? Especially since it was out of sight for a good 10 minutes while I was being questioned. Do we need to get the foreign embassy involved in case something happens?

Out of curiosity, how do they select who to screen anyway? I noticed hundreds of people going through security without a problem and during that time, I was the only one who underwent such heavy scrutiny. I am only here as a tourist and the only Palestinian places I visited are Jericho, Bethlehem and the Dead Sea area. Wondering if I had violated any rules."

For some reason I have recently felt a pull towards Jewish learning and belief, this is odd because I am a Catholic (mostly culturally, but I also can not bring myself to deny my faith), and I was surprised by some of the concepts I came across, mainly the concept that it is the job of the Jewish people to be a light to the nations. That you are supposed to be the spiritual leaders and illuminators of all people, and I was also surprised by the emphasis placed on our shared heritage. That we are all Gods children and He did not exclusively choose Jews to be his children. If I had thought about it, I would have suspected that that would be the correct theological position but I did not expect the emphasis on the fact that there is nothing inherently wrong with the gentile people. For some reason this affected me deeply and I felt so so thankful that you believe that.

Perhaps this was being contrasted with the Catholic attitude that all nations must become Catholic to be saved, something which always troubled me and in my heart of hearts I refused to believe that all the good and wonderful non Catholics would go to hell. I do not believe that.

But now I am curious of what do you ask of the gentiles ? What are your thoughts on our religions, are they beneficial ? This is purely complete conjecture, but if I were a Jew I would ascribe a great importance to the rise of ""Abrahamic religion"" among many of the nations of the world. My ancestors were pagans for the longest time, but when the latin church came to my ancestors ( I am ethnically Polish) they all of a sudden acknowledge God, and strive to live with morality and, in my opinion, to keep the 7 Noachide laws. Was that part of Gods plan? To spread these religions and change my pagan ancestors into ""a people of the book""?

I am rambling, but I just want to know what does Judaism really say I should be doing, should I be a Christian, how do I be a righteous gentile, is the degree and strictness of morality less for me than it is for a Jew ? And what do you think about the modern trend of abandoning our long held religious convictions, while still upholding a kind of morality ? I almost think Christianity spread and is now leaving, but it left an imprint on the European peoples of compassion and self sacrifice.

I don't know, now I am really rambling but if you have the time I will love to read everything you have to say on this matter. For the record I don't want to try and become a Jew in any way shape or form."

Beis Shammai says that one must consume both grilled red meat and beer; Beis Hillel says grilled red meat or beer. Others say that one fulfills his obligation even with grilled chicken or hard cider. The halacha follows the others.

There is a machlokes as to whether one can fulfill his obligation by eating vegetarian burgers. Our practice is to be machmir in this matter.

The mitzvah is to eat grilled meat & drink alcohol on July 4th. If one ate grilled food & drank alcohol on July 4 Eve, he has not fulfilled his obligation until he eats from his leftovers the next day & is drunk. The leftovers need not be reheated but one who does so is praiseworthy.

If one ate grilled fish, grilled corn or grilled onions, then gets drunk, he has fulfilled his obligation after the fact (b’dieved). If one ate vegan food, tofu, or fake meat, then gets drunk, he has not fulfilled his obligation.

1. When I initially googled Technion Medical School, 2 things popped up `The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine` and `Technion American Medical School`. Are these two different things or practically the same thing? I don't quite understand the distinction here. 
2. Someone told me that Technion has a curriculum where the Medical studies and Tech converge. How exactly is that established? Do they have people from different fields doing projects together? Does it mean there is a specific major/school where the student learns both Medicine and technology? 
3. I've heard bits and pieces about TRDF, T3, and THub. How are these faculties related to the studies in general? For instance, if one was in the Medical School, do they approach TRDF for research and grants? What is the significance of these faculties for the tech industry as well as the medical field in Israel?  "

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8f3kdfjraw9b1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4599146b8e1056764404d88441106fea091a4e80

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

One important task assigned to the marketing or sales departments in any corporation, large or small, is to get the word out about the company's products. There is no point in creating a product, however stellar it might be, if potential customers never find out that the product exists or where to purchase it.

However, another goal that a company may have is to create demand for its products where otherwise that demand might not exist.

Looking at this from a broader perspective, it is difficult to see the value to society as a whole, of corporations creating demand.

Societies need corporations in order to create the products and services that their members need and corporations can be far more efficient at these tasks than requiring each individual to create the product for themselves. In the large societies of today, information flow is a challenge, and so it makes sense that each corporation is tasked with enabling the information about its products to flow out towards the consumer.

[Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith) explained this process using the example of a [pin factory](https://www.johnkay.com/2019/12/18/adam-smith-and-the-pin-factory/). It might take me all day to make a single pin, but a factory that focuses on the task and employs just one person to concentrate on each of the component sub-processes involved in making the pin, can produce thousands of pins a day.

Moreover, the factory owner need not be motivated to help me or even to help society as a whole. It is sufficient that the owner wants to become rich and serve their own pleasures, for society as a whole to prosper. In this, economists were first coming to terms with the concepts of large complex systems composed of inanimate or ""selfish"" components that behave as if they have intentions, can predict the future, and are directed towards goals that none of these components are individually interested in.

Consider a different complex system: the multicellular biological organism. It is composed of cells that are individually ""motivated"" to ingest energy and reproduce. The organism as a whole develops stunningly complex systems of groups of such cells that include monitoring and cooperation behaviors. The organism as a whole acts as if motivated by goals that are very different from those of the individual cells but nevertheless further many of the ""goals"" of these member cells.

However, this careful balance can go wrong - from the perspective of the organism and then, indirectly, of the cells themselves. For example, an individual cell might overcome the monitoring processes designed to control its growth and become cancerous. In doing so, it is only furthering its programming, which is designed to ingest energy and reproduce. Ultimately, the organism as a whole may die as a result of this cancerous growth. Of course, the cancer cells do not benefit from this death either.

Economic systems can also go wrong when the benefits created by the selfish interests of individual players start to produce unwanted effects, which might ultimately end up undermining the system as a whole.

It is therefore perfectly understandable that a corporation should move beyond just informing a potential customer about its products; it is only following its programming in doing so. It makes sense that a company should invest in creating demand that does not exist and that does not serve the interests of society as a whole. It may help the company's profits to manipulate potential customers, to pervert the truthful flow of information, or to play on instinctive levels of the customer's decision-making processes.

Ultimately, neither society nor an organism can be healed with a sledgehammer. We need to understand the motivations driving the component parts of complex systems and gently nudge them to achieve our larger goals."

It's been 75 years and Palestinians have received billions of dollars in funding. Moreover, PA is in control of Area A, not Israel.

This victim caricature of the ""innocent"" Palestinian refugee is intended to play on Western sentimentalist thinking without any regard for the reality that Palestinians claim descendants of descendants are “refugees” no matter where they live and what citizenship they have — the only group to have such a definition. By that logic, everyone is a refugee because their parents, grandparents, or great grandparents were probably from somewhere else."

I'm curious about the fintech and digital payment scene in Israel, coz these days, many news that I see on the web are more focused on South East Asia and major Asian countries in general as it keeps growing here. So, Israel seems to be out of the loop, apparently.

In my home country Malaysia, cashless payment is accelerating, to the extent that sometimes, I don't bring my wallet anymore and just bring my phone to make payments through QR in stores, supermarkets, and even some roadside food stalls. I would only do that if I know that particular store/stall accepts QR payments.

Also, about the QR payment, we have a standardized system called DuitNow where all QR codes can be used by different banking and eWallet apps when making payments. This also extends to money transfers as well, which I personally did from time to time.

Of course, we also use card payments (Mastercard & Visa) in stores, so most stores and restaurants these days have the option to pay either by cash (which is still prevalent, btw), card, or QR.

Apple Pay and Samsung Pay are available too, but they are only available in certain banks, and very few use both IRL. The adoption of both is minuscule compared to QR payments.

Not to mention, I can also use QR payment from my Malaysian eWallet/banking app in Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore, and I personally did it when I visited Thailand a month ago without a hitch.

So my question is, how is the current fintech scene here, and what do Israelis, in general, prefer to use when making payments? Would love to know more from you all, and of course, feel free to ask me any questions to me on the digital payment scene here too :D

Their own presence is largely derived from 1,000+ years of migration waves similar to the Aliyahs in which various clans and peoples from outside the area's boundaries showed up with permission from an Imperialistic ruler, without taking any bizarre referendums from every Jew or Samaritan who lived there before them, and started building settlements ( Like Nablus and Modern Ramallah ), then vied for public territory for an Arab state, and contended it's wrong for Jews to undertake the exact same process. ( And in what to be used the former territory of sovereign native Jewish nations before Imperialist rule, no less. )

  
But now I am here to discuss the more humanitarian side of the Zionist-Arab conflict's origins and ponder the question of what would happen if, in an alternate reality, a very ""self-hating"", ""shameful"" and ""weak"" Arab world would have in fact openly welcomed the various propositions for partition which were put forward over the years and told the Jews: ""Yes, you can have your Jewish nation-state in that tiny strip of land you asked for.""  


As we know, anti-Zionists enjoy likening the Zionist Project and the 'horrors' of the above to historical events like the colonization of the Americas - where sovereign, self-ruling tribes, tribal confederations, nations etc were conquered in the name of foreign kings by the sword, sacked for all their gold and resources worth, and ultimately went completely extinct with every single inch of the continent under European hegemony to the point their cause or narrative hardly even exists anymore, or to South Africa which followed a similar trajectory from the Age of Exploration all the way up to Apartheid, with the added bonus of slavery and race laws, to the fondness of Arab Redditors or Mahmoud Abbas to call Zionists 'worse than the Nazi's' ( I'm not making any comparisons, only a demonstrable reference ), and other deranged analogies.

Now, let's imagine a scenario in which the Arabs of Palestine, decades before 1948 and before the failed Zionist negotiations with various Arab leaders and widespread massacres of Jews in the 1920's irreparably plunge the region into a civil war, most Arabs accept the Zionist rationale and sign on the parameters presented by two-state partition plans of that period from the great powers. How badly would they have screwed themselves and how horribly would their lives be by capitulating to what we are told is an evil, inhumane, expansionist, racist ideology akin to the worst colonialist regimes in all of human history? Let's review the facts and make some reasonable assessments:

**1 - What the Arab Nationalists would be agreeing to by international standards** 

The legal stipulations of most of these partition plans up to the very last and famous UN partition plan were an almost completely homogeneous Arab State governing territory equally, if not more valuable than Israel's ( Considering half of theirs is just the empty Negev desert ), and a Jewish State that would be 60% Jewish and 40% Arab at the onset.

The implications of being the nation-state of the Jewish people, or a Jewish state, much as with any given 'Arab State' or Arab Republic would be cultural and symbolic at the state level - the flag, official languages, inclusion of Jewish holidays, and so on. Religious affairs would likely be inherited from Ottoman law just as in the state of Israel today with Shariah Courts, Churches and the Rabbinate overseeing respective religious affairs or ceremonies of the communities, and likewise from a civil affairs perspective communities would be able to preserve their own customs with Arabic-Language or Islamic schools still in existence and so on and so forth.

The most notably affected aspect is probably immigration policy with the Right of Return guaranteeing automatic safe haven and citizenship to diaspora Jews. Without the Independence War, the Nakba never occurs, and discussion about a Palestinian-Arab right of return is no longer relevant. As for the Palestinian-Arabs who are now Israeli citizens, the partition emphasizes that they have fully equal rights and retain all private properties and private lands. Additionally, with the two countries recognizing each other and being at peace, freedom of movement and possibly even residency would be granted to citizens with personal or economic ties across the border.  


Doesn't really seem like any kind of humanitarian crisis to me which brings us to the next point.

**2 - Can the Zionists be trusted not to violate the agreement** 

Many Anti-Zionists then claim that Israel would likely breach the agreement anyway. One of the biggest flaws in that theory among others in this context is that they stem from a more contemporary view of Zionist-Arab relations in our own timeline, which would be vastly different in an alternate one even before 1948. One of the first radical Zionist factions, Irgun, literally stated in its charter that it aims to commit reprisal attacks as a retribution for earlier massacres targeting Jews by Arab Nationalists. Many of the plans drafted by militant Zionist factions or their positions were informed by extreme hostilities and diplomatic failure with the Arab Nationalists from mainstream representatives.

Joining those organizations isn't exactly child's play - you get shot by an Arab militant and die, you get jailed or tortured by the British, etc, you generally don't want to be there unless there's upheaval and ethnic strife all around you already. In a reality in which Arab society conceded a Jewish state without opposition, and where Jewish civilians have never been attacked in Arab communities, the recruitment drive of fascist elements instigating a war with the entire Arab world just so they can go claim the territory of the other Arab State has likely been incredibly weakened, and it is doubtful they exist at all unless it's to fight the British, but let's assume they're still around for the sake of argument.

A lot of Israelis died in the 1948 Independence War, and victory against multiple established nations was not guaranteed, a fact agreed upon by Arab leaders who bragged, much like Putin, that they would squash Israel in a matter of weeks. There are many divisions within Israel today, including when it comes to settlements, the conflict, and so on, and if anything the Left used to be stronger in the past than it is now.

Getting all the Jews fleeing persecution from Europe to agree to throw themselves into the meat grinder of war while vastly outnumbered and outgunned against those who already accepted a sovereign safe haven for Jews to live in just for the other half or to deprive them of rights would be a comically difficult internal political feat, but let's pretend it happens anyway and speculate on the results of the Zionist War of Aggression:

* Low morale among drafted Israeli soldiers - they are not fighting for independence or their own survival any longer
* Uncertain alliance with the Hashemites - the Jordanian King might not be too eager to sign any agreement with a nation that doesn't respect treaties and actively invades the other nation they agreed to recognize
* Uncertain alliance with Druze communities - Palestinian-Arabs are no longer self-declared enemies, rather they were betrayed by the Zionists. The Druze might now be much more reluctant to take anything promised to them at face value.
* Reduced international support - Israel never had too many allies or much direct assistance in the actual 1948 war, and in this reality they are now spitting in the face of every great power and country they gave their word to, at least some sympathetic countries selling weapons no longer do so, at least some countries are now more willing to assist the Arab side instead.
* Much higher Arab morale - Neighboring leaders are probably now *genuinely* afraid that they're next on the list of violent conquests rather than just 'failing to liberate all of Palestine', likely commit way more troops and more resources by all means necessary than they previously had.

There is a much higher chance that if Israel breaks its peace agreements, it ends up losing the ensuing war in this scenario.

**3 - Future of the Palestinian-Arabs in the Jewish State** 

In the alternate universe where the precepts of Zionism have been fulfilled with Arab-Zionists endorsement and the Israeli-Arab conflict never happens, several changes likely happen:

* In the modern era,systemic racism within Israel is at an all-time low. 
* Without Arab-Israeli animosity, Jewish Exodus from the Arab states never occurs. A portion of Jews still immigrates to Israel, but comparably to countries like France or the U.S, much less than before. Israeli foreign affairs are likely heavily influenced by and beholden to friendly Arab countries with cultural bridges between Israel's higher Arab population and their Jewish populations
* With no taboo on Arab participation in Israeli society and no major seditious tendencies, and no security threats, Israeli-Arab involvement in the state apparatus is at an all-time high with Arab citizens occupying positions of power in almost every sector 
* Mixed schools and cities are much more common, as are mixed marriages between secular Jews and secular Arabs

Overall, the only distinctions are, similarly to other nation-states, the Jewish state's symbolic and ceremonial functions, the 'Jus Sanguinis' open immigration for Jews abroad, and constitutional provisions against the dissolution of the Jewish State, which are all mirrored in the Arab nation-state. If Arab Nationalists had initially accepted Zionism, I do not believe there would be any negative change to the quality of life, oppression or disenfranchisement of the Mandate's Arab population whatsoever."

We obviously aren't religious, don't keep shabbat or eat kosher. We agreed on a Jewish name, and that we don't raise our child religious. Now he decided he wants circumcision because that's his heritage and I'm honestly feeling really bad about the idea to start the life of this baby in pain. Where baby will be born, only 0.8% of the male population is circumcised, so most of his peers won't be unless there is a health reason. It is legal for religious reasons, but given that I'm not jewish, I don't think religious reasons are legit. 
Is this really so very important, would he be any more accepted by the jewish community if we did it? 
Honestly, I feel like I would rather keep shabbat for the rest of my life than causing pain to this little being. I also feel like I have no rights to make an irreversible decision about someone else's body. If he decides later in life that he wants a bar mitzva and he needs to get it done for it,, I would be supportive of that. Would it make any difference from a jewish perspective whether he did it as a baby or later in life? Even if we chose to do it, it wouldn't be a religious ceremony on day 8, just a medical event on day 2-3.

Edit to say: I was ready to be downvoted here and excluded, and I'm so grateful for the supportive comments. Thank you!"

Israel, as a state, always had a fascist and colonial element to it. Beginning from Theodore Herzl’s colonial endeavor in the 1880’s and growing with David Ben-Gurion’s rise to power in the 1940’s, the Zionist movement tended to cling to the tail of moribund Western colonialism in its waning years. The MAPAI (“Labor” Party) regime, in power from 1948 to 1977 – now treated with nostalgia by the Zionist “left” – was thoroughly fascist.

It is responsible for the Nakba – the expulsion of 750,000 Palestinians from what is now Israel proper – and for numerous other fascistic acts, both against Palestinians and against Jews in Israel and abroad. From the kidnapping of Mizrachi children in the 1950’s to aid to fascist (and Antisemitic) regimes in Latin America in the early 1970’s, this regime displayed its fascist and racist face openly. This fascist system did not disappear when MAPAI lost power in 1977, with its right-wing replacement, Herut (“Freedom” Party), now the Likud Party, continuing many of its policies.

However, both Mapai and the old incarnation of Herut were partially, maybe mostly, secular. They followed Western colonial and fascist tendencies but did not wish to establish a theocracy or bring about the Messiah. By doling out limited privileges to large parts of Israel’s Jewish population, the Israeli ruling class created the impression among many Israelis that they are living in a democracy, rather than under a fascist regime. This illusion, carefully maintained by the Israeli state apparatus, is crucial for understanding the current protests.

The current Netanyahu regime allied itself with the most extreme theocratic elements within Israel’s far right wing. Unlike the previous incarnations of the Israeli state, the current administration is ready to shed off any semblance of democracy and does not see the illusion of democracy to be necessary to maintain its rule. Now, they are moving to apply all fascist instruments used against Palestinians – to all those who reside between the River and the Sea, including Jews. This is coupled with a strong theocratic tendency, breaking the old “status que” social contract which maintained a limited degree of freedom from religion in Israel.

Many Israeli Jews, especially from the more educated and wealthier demographic, see this transformation as a frontal assault on their freedom, wellbeing, and (limited) privileges. Ironically, many of the current protesters did not bat an eye when such fascistic methods were used against Palestinians in the past 75 years or even before that. However, this led to mass protests – among the largest Israel has ever seen – against the Netanyahu regime and his far-right theocratic allies.

One must be careful to avoid illusions about the protests’ leadership. For example, Shikma Schwartzman-Bressler, a famous icon of the protest leadership, openly expressed enthusiastic support for the destructive and bloody IDF operation in Jenin in early July 2023. Other leaders include IDF pilots, some of whom are responsible for massive destruction and a high civilian death toll in Gaza in the past two decades. Others are IDF generals, again responsible for maintaining the occupation of the West Bank and the siege of Gaza, who now oppose the same policies they enacted against Palestinians once such policies are enacted against them (the pilots) as well.

Many of the protest “rank and file” are also strongly nationalist (Zionist) and militarist. The “Brothers in Arms” protest movement, for example, wears its militarism on its sleeve, so to speak, and its members often brag about their military careers and demand even wider conscription of Jews to the IDF. They oppose Strict Orthodox (Haredim) exemption from service and wish to forcibly conscript them into the ranks of the IDF, to help maintain the occupation regime.

However, on the other hand, one must also be careful not to treat the protests as a single unit, especially not as uniformly nationalist and militarist. Many others of the protesters are not organized militarist activists, but rather previous non-political Israeli citizens scared of the possibility of a theocratic regime. Currently, they are marching under the banners of the militarist and nationalistic leadership, but the protests, by necessity, politicize them. The question of what they will be politicized to is an open one. This is a massive opportunity for those who wish to create a truly democratic order between the River and the Sea.

Also, a growing leftist current within the protests, the Anti-Occupation Bloc, openly challenges the protest leadership. This Bloc points at the “Elephant in the Room” – the occupation of the West Bank, the siege on Gaza, and the general colonialist elements of Israeli society – and reminds the protestors of what many do not want to be reminded of. This Bloc, started by a few leftist activists and the Israeli Communist Party, experiences steady growth.

The leadership hates the Bloc with passion. Recently, in early July 2023, when the Anti-Occupation Bloc raised banners condemning West Bank settler pogroms against Palestinians, members of the Brothers in Arms physically assaulted them. Such is the fear of the protest leadership from the truth being exposed, of the “Elephant in the Room” being brought into the foreground. Such attacks are not new; protesters waving Palestinian flags, or even red flags, in the protests were often attacked – usually verbally – by the mainstream protest leadership.

It is the duty of the Anti-Occupation Bloc, and of any honest proponent of true democracy, to continue and expose the occupation regime in every protest. Many of the rank-and-file protestors have been won to the ruling class’s nationalist and militarist positions – but many were not, at least not fully so. Openly opposing the leadership and openly reminding everyone of the occupation and of the colonial elements in Israeli society, is a crucial step towards building a mass pro-democratic movement in Israel.

Such movement must demand equality and freedom for everyone living between the River and the Sea; an end to the siege of Gaza; an end to state terror and settler terror; and, eventually, a single, democratic state from the River to the Sea, with equal rights and full personal and political freedom for all ethnicities living here, Jews and Palestinians included.

I was reading the documents the 1983 Reform Judaism outline for patrilineal descent, as well as the Reconstructionist decree. Both of them clearly state that if a child is patrilineal then the child has to be raised Jewish (which they further specify as having a bris (if male), Hebrew education, bar/bat mitzvah, and confirmation). I know people who are patrilineal who did none of these things and only ever celebrated Hanukkah and Passover with their extended family, and that was the extent of their Jewish exposure. However, they now claim they are fully Jewish and that the Reform and Reconstructionist communities view them as such. This goes against what they outline in their own decrees. Am I missing something? Did the rules change unofficially? I don’t want to tell someone they’re not Jewish, but also believe in following the rules of a religion. 

Can someone shed some light onto this?"

Four years ago I heard a song that to this day I wasn't able to find. I heard it on a Israeli radio station and these are the chorus lyrics that I remember (I don't speak Hebrew so I have no idea what those words are or if I wrote them correctly which I most probably didn't):  


Ahava miakodesh bilenu   
Chana, rachamim bezakha   
Chesed emet, tsedek veyosher   
Tuv lemale neosher  


It was something like hiphop with a female chorus. Song is special to me because it was playing when I was going through something important at that time and I would be so grateful if you could help me find it finally. Thanks!"

The recent Jenin raid made me inquire about the status of political parties to see how Israelis viewed their current government, and I have a couple of questions/thoughts:

1.  First, it is good to finally see some movement in polling.

2.  Why is the far right nosediving at the moment?  It seemed that Israelis had a sector of the population moving towards the far right and leading to the popularity of these parties, and I'm not sure what would have driven this particular sector away from them. 

3.  Likud also taking a hit in the polls... Is this because of the association with the far right parties and current government performance?

4.  National Unity rising quickly at the expense of Yeah Atid makes sense since they occupy similar areas of the political spectrum.  I assume NU is also receiving some moderate former Likud support.  How is other political support moving around?  Where did the former far right support go?  Did Yesh Atid leak to the left also?

Thank you!"

This also results in a more aggressive response from the Palestinians in the West Bank. 

In the United States and across Europe a sort of counter revolution has begun as a counterbalance to the leftist ideals that once gripped the western world in the last couple of years. 

As conflict rages on the edge of Europe the people hearts and minds continue to militarize and harden at the thought of what may be to come. 

Western governments continue to support Israel but the citizens and especially the far right hold reservations and often racism towards Israelis and even Jewish people. 

My question to Israelis is what do you think of the gradual heading towards the far right. Do you think it may expose Israel to danger in the future? How have more moderate parties been represented in the Netanyahu Gvir coalition. What is your hope for the near future?"

116,2023-07-05,Getting hit on at synagogue,u/notfrumenough,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14qsmb1/getting_hit_on_at_synagogue/,"Hi there. Looking for advice. 

It seems one of the fellows at synagogue has some interest in me (40f) as he keeps talking to me during and after services and at Shabbat dinner. 

There’s a mechitza at shul but the kitchen and back door is behind the women’s seating and is always open because the kids go between the play area and their moms. Sometimes during breaks in services or when its time to wash he starts chatting me up and doesn’t stop even when services start again. 

For example on Shavuot in between Torah reading and kabbalat Shabbat he came in the kitchen to eat cheesecake and had me stuck in the corner being chatting at by him even when the rabbi started saying brachas again, and my trying to follow along in the siddur didn’t seem to stop him from talking to me. Even when I said “the Rabbi is going so fast today” he laughed it off and kept talking. Then on another Shabbat he kept talking to me until the Rabbi pulled him away for kiddush. This last week he kept talking while the rabbi and rebbetzin were davening in their home until I went to sit next to her and grabbed a siddur. Then as I was leaving and my kids were tired and waiting for me, he kept talking and trying to show me pics on his phone and I kept saying no thanks I need to go it’s late, then he asked me out for coffee. I said sure, not realizing that he was probably asking me on a date, and then later realized I messed up. 

Now rabbi is asking me if I want him to give the guy my number, and he also offered to reject him for me. I said that’s OK bc I think it’s most respectful if I do it myself.

He is nice enough but I’m not interested in him in that way (or kind of at all tbh) and I’m dating someone right now anyway for 6+ months who says he loves me. 

The fellow is a regular at synagogue and it’s a pretty small group of people so I will 100% see him again. How do I let him know I’m not interested and want space without making it awkward or hurtful? And also what if I want to bring my bf with me sometime? Actually maybe bringing my boyfriend with would be a really good way to convey that I’m not available. 😅

Just sucks because I’m going there to pray not to chat with dudes during the service and also I don’t want to be cornered and spend all my time with this guy at Shabbat dinner either.

Should I just stop going for a little while and go to a different synagogue? 

ty

tl;dr guy keeps talking to me at shul and I’m not really interested in him, should I just stop going for a while?"

But I've always been told that my grandfather was from a Jewish family from North Africa. He died when I was a child but I have extremely fond and sweet memories of him. He and my father didn't really go along well and they spent most of their lives separated. Yet anyone who met him told me that I look identical to him, and my mother says that even our personalities look very similar (I got to spend time with him thanks to my mother who encouraged my gf attempts to reconcile with his son). I've always felt this connection to Jewish people through him, and always had the curiosity to find out what exactly happened to him and his family, why they were chased out from Tunisia and my ancestry in general.

After finding the courage I've started doing some basic research. For a while I couldn't find any record of him being Jewish, and my family name also doesn't show any result. Once I met an Israeli girl who seemed to recognize my surname as ""the fluffiest part of the sheep's wool"" but I cannot find this information myself and I wonder if she just misheard mee. I feel a bit lost, I never thought myself as a member of the Jewish people, but I've always prided myself to be a descendant of one. 

Tonight I started to question the whole story. Maybe I was wrong from beginning. Maybe his father wasn't Jewish and his mother only (I don't even know her name). Maybe in the messy relationships of my family there was some huge misunderstanding. Anyway I feel like I lost an important tassel of my identity."

I found out recently that Asherah was actually the goddess of heaven, and our monotheistic god’s wife. And I can’t stop thinking about it. 

I’ve been reading that there are cults who still pray to Asherah, and that some of them have somewhat satanic vibes. I’m very spiritually jewish and pray to god all the time, but I find myself having trouble reconciling this new information. 

What does it mean to be named after a god we don’t pray to? Is there a way for me to honor her without it being idolatry? 

Curious to hear your thoughts."
2,2023-07-05,Converting and questions on acceptance/motherhood,u/FavoriteDaughter2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14qxnk5/converting_and_questions_on_acceptancemotherhood/,"My mother in law was the first of her lineage to convert from Judaism to Christianity. She did this when my husband was little so he was raised Christian amongst Jewish cousins, aunts, and uncles. On his AncestryDNA test, it says he’s 45% Russian Jewish so ethnically, he identifies as Jewish. We are in the process of converting to Reform (both of us) as it’s important our kids have faith and identify with their heritage. My husband and I are very excited. We attend class once a week and are connected with our local rabbi but have yet to meet beyond email exchange. We are also members of our local J (and love it!) I wasn’t raised with any religion so finding Judaism has meant the world to me. I admittedly am still making sense of the identity aspect of it though. I’m only 4 months into classes so it’s still early. My husband doesn’t feel like an outsider in the way that I do, and understandably so. He’s attended Seders, Hanukkah dinners, Jewish funerals, etc. 

I really want our kids (now toddlers) to be proud of their Jewishness and not question or feel less than because their parents converted. Do you have any advice on how I can better step into owning my identify throughout this process? Thanks so much 🤍"

My wife and I have decided we're going to consider aliyah within a 2-3 year timeline, and for next visit go to places that have a similar culture to Tel Aviv but a lower cost of living. Beersheva keeps popping up on suggestions, possibly also Modi'in. I'm leaving this as vague as possible. We visited Beersheva for a short time and it seemed similar to Austin, TX where we currently live both in climate, culture, and geography.  


We don't need the cheapest options possible, but reasonably calm (I respect people in Sderot but don't think I could handle the tension), and preferably off a train line to Tel Aviv. We plan on having conversational Hebrew proficiency before we arrive and will be studying for the next two years online.

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

We often see the role of the legislative process as creating laws, and the judicial branch as tasked with applying them. While this view is perfectly valid, there are other ways to look at this distinction.

Another perspective is that the mission of the legislative branch is to create the rules of the game that will help coordinate our efforts to cooperate on the goals that we share. The task of the judicial branch is to resolve otherwise violent conflicts, either between two members of society, or between the executive branch and a participant.

Violent conflict gives the upper hand to the stronger party. Justice, on the other hand, is supposed to evaluate the evidence impartially and guarantee that the fact that one party has more power, in any form, plays no part in deciding the final outcome. Neither side must have any advantage, whether rich or poor, educated or ignorant, powerful or weak, a member of the majority ethnicity or a minority. None of these should affect the judicial reasoning in any way.

The legislative process, on the other hand, is not required to be so even-handed. If most of the members of society have, as one of their personal goals, the desire to help the poor, weak or unfortunate, then the legislative process should create rules that will enable society to coordinate special help for those in need.

One question that the legislative process must face is whether the judicial system can ever, in practice, achieve the ideal of perfect fairness between the parties. The rich might hire better lawyers, the educated might be able to make a better case, and human judges are never free of all prejudices.

When faced with this reality, there are two alternatives: One of these is for the judicial system to ignore its own failings, to do its best to achieve the ideal of fairness, and never to give any side an advantage, even if the weak and poor might lose out in the process.

The other alternative is for the legislative process to accept that human judicial processes are necessarily flawed. The law must intervene and force the legislative process to be ""unfair"" in such cases where being unfair is more likely to create justice. This might mean that, for example, a wealthy protagonist might face the frustration of seeing advantages being given to the other party that would not be given to them.

Both alternatives are bad, but perhaps a dynamic tension between these two perspectives will yield a better outcome than dogmatically supporting one side or the other."

I'll be over next month for a family visit but staying up North this time with the exception of a little trip to visit family in the Otef Aza region.

62,2023-07-05,I'm a pregnant goy and the frum grandparents are becoming very interested - how do I handle this?,u/Cultural_Owl9547,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14rbgs5/im_a_pregnant_goy_and_the_frum_grandparents_are/,"This is a continuation of a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14qfjl7/comment/jqqsamz/?context=3) yesterday where I got lots of support around the circumcision question, so I hope to broaden the question a bit, and ask for advice if that's ok. 

When I met my partner three years ago, he was completely disconnected from Judaism and his parents for at least 10 years already. He left Jerusalem when he was 16 and moved to New York alone, he later gave another shot to religion but it didn't work for him, so he left again completely when he was 26, now he is 40. 

His dad is a rabbi in Jerusalem. His parents didn't disown him, but they barely had any contact. I grew up Christian and always had an interest in Judaism, so I was always open to traditions, went to Chabad together a few times, and encouraged him to find a healthier connection to his roots. There was also a little openness from the other side; I was on some of their family video calls, and we had a connection. 

When I got pregnant, they stopped talking to me which wasn't surprising to us, and even though I felt really sad about the heartless grandparents who won't accept their grandchild, I was ok with it, and I was aware of this being the most likely outcome. 

Well, 6 months into the pregnancy, they came to visit us. They've been really nice! It has been super-duper difficult for us to figure out how to accommodate their needs. The only kosher hotel of the country wasn't kosher enough for them, and they arrived right before shabbat, and we live in the countryside where there is no synagogue and no kosher food, so we needed to stay in the capital instead of our beach home, but it has been a good visit, they really went out of their way to not express to my face what they really think about me being pregnant with their grandchild, and I went out of my way to dress modest and not get a bottle of water in the heat on a shabbat so that I don't have to carry it or pay for it. We had some great conversations and great connections, but I had this feeling in the back of my head that it wouldn't be safe to fully trust them. 

I'm now afraid that it went a bit too well. My partner now wants circumcision, his mum expressed that she doesn't like our choice of name and asked about our doctor's visits, and his dad reached out to me about mutual respect. It scares me a bit. I want our child to know his roots, and I have many secular Jews in my friend circles to hang out with, I'm really supportive of him learning Jewish and also Christian culture, Hungarian and also Israeli culture as it's all part of who he will be, and he'll have to navigate this third culture identity to which I'm prepared for. But I don't want religious radicalism in the family, and they are extreme. My partner has another non-jewish child from another woman, and they don't care about her. I have a fear that my being knowledgeable and open to Judaism makes them feel like there is a chance that they can impose their rules on us. 

On the other hand, my partner is flying from happiness, experiences lots of healing, and feels accepted. I'm really happy for him, and I would love for my boy to have 2 sets of grandparents, but I have no idea how to handle this enormous difference between their lifestyle and our lifestyle. I would be open to sending our kid to a secular Jewish school, but I can't imagine not being able to have a damn lemonade at a random bar because we don't know whether the knife they used to cut the lemon is kosher. I find them very extreme and radical, and these radical extreme views are not welcome to my family, especially since I also know that they will never treat me equally to them. They will always think they are superior to me, and this doesn't make me feel safe."

32,2023-07-05,Tzom Tammuz Megathread,u/drak0bsidian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14rdk85/tzom_tammuz_megathread/,"This is the megathread for the minor fast day [צום תמוז](https://www.hebcal.com/holidays/tzom-tammuz-2023).

This is **NOT** in any way meant to limit the number of minor or fast posts standing alone in the sub.

However, wherever, and with whomever you’re going to not eat, you won’t be *alone* for this relatively small day of the year. Ask questions and share ideas here to help your fellow Jews deprive themselves to remember when the walls came tumblin' down.

The Seventeenth of Tammuz starts this year at dawn on **Thursday, July 06** and runs until dark. On haLuakh haIvri, it all happens on . . . **17 Tammuz**.

Shiv'a'asar b'Tammuz commemorates when the walls of the Second Temple were breached by the Romans, ahead of the Temple's destruction (on Tisha b'Av). The day marks the beginning of the three-week mourning period, *Bein haMetzarim*, leading up to Tisha b’Av.

The day also marks when:

1. Moshe broke the two Tablets on Har Sinai;
2. the regular sacrifice was not made during the Babylonian siege;
3. a Roman soldier burned a Torah scroll (he was then executed in an attempt to placate the Jews); and
4. an idol was erected in the Temple.

As a minor fast, it begins at dawn (first light) and ends at nightfall (full dark).

I won't list them out of respect and because listing them isn't very relevant to my question but
who is it that decides wether a Jew should follow something in the Talmud or not?

I understand in the Talmud there's contradicting verses but how is it determined what a Jew should and shouldn't follow and who determines that and why is it they who determines that? Or is it a free for all and anyone can interpret it however they feel is most correct?

Also I understand polygamy isn't practiced anymore by Jews, this (afaik) is because a rabbi said not to therefore I question why does a rabbi have authority to change religious law? Why do you respect it and what's stopping another rabbi popping up and changing the law even further?

Saying something like ""the rabbis who put that in the talmud were oppressed or from a different time"" isn't an excuse, therefore either the whole talmud has legitimacy within Judaism or there's some scoring system that I don't understand."

My (F29) soon to be husband (M29) has recently taken an interest in Judaism. Our common ground for problem solving had been a psychology approach in our 8 years of dating, but he wants to apply the teachings in Judaism from now on.
This entails the role of husband and wife, their responsibilities towards each other, and the overall treatment of family.
I am not a Jew so I am mostly oblivious to its teachings in these areas.
He says that a man should honor his parents always, and obey them as long as their demand does not contradict religious oblogations, even if the requests are not reasonable.
He is a mommy's boy by nature, and they have a very toxic relationship with each other and he has been in therapy for a few years but the toxic relationship persists. His mother hates me and openly talks behind my back in front him, insults me when together, and has kept demanding that we break up for several years. She does everything in her power to negatively affect our relationship and convince him that I am not a good partner, intrudes our private life and finances and so on.
My question is, what are the limits of parental obedience, since he refuses to confront the mother and set boundries because he ""has to honor and obey"" his parents with the only exception being in when it's contradictory to religion. 
Does Judaism specify who is to be prioritized in case of conflict and what if the mother's requests are unhealthy, invasive, and having negative impacts in our relationship? If he were to set boundries, and deny his mothers requests wouldn't this be in contrast to what religion wants him to do? 
Specific sources for this matter are appreciated since I am trying to educate myself on the matter and be able to have a discussion with mutual ground with him."

maybe it’s good to push a narrative to all jewish people that they are connected ethnically to avoid issues in the future relating to phenotypes, race etc.  thus, avoiding separation or avoiding the weakening of israeli nationalism within people (zionism).

i’m not entirely sure.. i’d love to know what you think.



EDIT:
people in the replies tell me how it’s an ethnicity then go on to explain to me how they’re mostly only similar in religion. it does not make sense that a ethiopian jew is ETHNICALLY the same as a middle eastern jew or a european jew. Also, many seem to forget that you can literally convert to judaism. 

if i wasn’t jewish and then converted does that mean that i become a part of this ethnic group? you’re BORN within an ethnic group and can’t join it.

I can’t become or convert to yazidism or druzism for example. these two would most definitely be examples of an ethnicity or an ethnoreligion. 

some of these comments also push a severe and obvious political agenda and are unnecessarily harsh.


EDIT2: 
is race and ethnicity tied? if not, then i can see how judaism is an ethnicity"

i recently made a post a while ago about how i noticed the similarities of how hispanics and jews get treated in america. and how the both of our communities in many ways deal with the same types of evils. 

the response to my post was heart warming. i’m happy we were able to connect in a way that was not only productive and meaningful.

this post i’m making is definitely may not be the right place to post here, and it his mods let me know. but i was wanting to ask y’all (the jewish community here on reddit) to say a prayer for the victims of the el paso shooting?

the man who committed the shooting was a neo nazi and a white nationalist. and as expected held antisemitic beliefs. but also had a hatred for hispanics and latinos. 

in a way, i see this as an opportunity for us to come together and do something good for the victims of the tragedy. even if it’s something that may seem small, such as a prayer. but to me prayer is a very powerful tool, and it’s something that i’ve grown to appreciate over time.

The “wills” are handwritten suicide notes asking parents not to be sad because their child has achieved glorious martyrdom or fervent wishes that their martyrdom, however insignificant, will achieve millennial dreams of liberation.

Parents, like those described in [my post several months ago about parents in Nablus lamenting their kids joining terror gangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/zpwtga/parents_in_nablus_fret_over_their_children/), aren’t encouraging but seem powerless to stop their kids from following the martyrdom pied piper. 

A teacher is quoted as pleading with his students not to throw away their lives, but he is waved off.  Others are quoted with predictable explanations about the kids being frustrated by the nationalistic political impasse with Palestine, or the daily oppression of checkpoints, or wanting to feel like they are doing important adult things.

So the Times feature explains the phenomenon of Palestinian youth engaging in a lemming like suicide martyrdom by Israeli solider ultimately with the explanation of colonialist oppression that basically makes its hopeless youth commit suicide as a form of widespread protest, like Buddhist monks setting themselves aflame to protest the Vietnam war.

But is that the correct frame for this situation?  The Times analysis totally omits two critical, highly significant facts that anyone who reads this sub for a month will see someone refer to: (1) the battle over UNRWA school curricula and (2) Martyrs Fund and its role in the Palestinian economy.

(1) According to NGO watchdog agencies like IMPACT-SE, Palestinian textbooks and curriculula are highly militant and jihadist and promote violence against Jews and martyrdom from grades 3 - 12. Not only do these materials encourage jihad and delegitimize Israel, but the instructions are hamhandedly worked into arithmetic and physics workbook lessons, subtracting dead soldiers or the calculating the force of a slingshot rock.  

The NGOs, UN and EU who pay for the textbooks have admonished the PA and Hamas to dial back the Israel hate, but since 2014 according to IMPACT-SE it gets steadily worse every year — almost as if the Palestinian powers that be were spitefully ignoring western entreaties for moderation and re-introducing discussions of peace (existence of Israel, Oslo Accords) and pushing back by making childhood instruction even more stridently propagandistic.  

And aside from school instruction, one assumes many if not most of these kids receive indoctrination from parents or Imams about the prejudices and grievances that Muslims have with Jews over Palestine (don’t know much about the religious education angle, or indeed whether boys commonly go to mosques with their fathers etc., but certainly long-standing, never revoked fatwa generally command the faithful to jihad over Palestine and fighting to avenge this cosmic injustice of Palestine and Nakba).

(2) The Martyr’s Fund pays the families of the martyred children and prisoners a stipend which is higher than the prevailing wages or salaries in the Palestinian areas of the West Bank.  It is a serious factor in the Palestinian economy: **about half** of the total amount of revenues received by the PA from international aid.  This policy of the PA is also criticized by Israel and the Palestinians’ western funders.

So, the two biggest discretionary uses of money by the PA are to incentivize martyrdom and to inculcate violent, nihilistic fanaticism and glorification of kamikaze attacks by teenagers.  And parents and teachers in Jenin profess cluelessness to Times reporters, who I’m willing to bet are totally unaware of the two key factors of context I just mentioned which make this inexplicable martyrdom fad make a lot more sense.

If Americans were aware of these two key missing factors, they might better correctly understand the situation in more familiar terms: cult behavior and fanaticism, not the colonialist oppression and despair of the wretched of the earth.

And if they viewed the Jenin youth through this lens, they might too be outraged by the cynicism and evil of the faceless government and religious leaders and bureaucrats who put this poison in the textbooks of eight year olds and divert much of the government’s funds to paying its citizens for killing Jews."

Palestinians especially in Jenin have begun to protest against the PA saying that they are unable to protect civilians or stop the incursions into their communities.

The IDF’s undermining of the PA is going to backfire as the people look for more “proactive” leadership in these difficult times.

As the death toll rises armed groups gain more soldiers and the Palestinians see the occupation as more and more intolerable.

What does Israel really gain from these incursions. Collateral damage and media coverage do little to help legitimize the settlements or raids. 

Why do you support or don’t support these raids?

Don’t they increase hostility b/w Arab and Israeli populations in Israel?"

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

We tend to think of a person's personality as something quite fixed and unchanging. While minor details might change over time, in general, genes, culture, and personal history determine who we are, what we care about, and the kind of behavior we are likely to display.

We also tend to imagine that people in other cultures could not have been all that different deep down. The fact that societies in history were less materially capable, could only mean that individuals were more brutal, selfish, and focused on their own survival. It may be difficult for us to imagine cultures where people cared for each other much more than in our own culture. (Historians might not be very reliable about this detail, since researchers can only interpret the few facts that they do have using the lens of their own beliefs and attitudes. They will tend to assume people then were more similar to us than they were in reality.)

However, perhaps our values, beliefs, and behavior are not very fixed at all. Perhaps the most consistent component of human personality is the ability to adapt. When another person treats us badly, we assume that the rules of the game call for bad, selfish behavior that prioritizes self-protection. When someone is kind to us, we tend to change our view of society, and start seeing it as being cooperative and based on mutual help.

This alternative view sees change as potentially happening very fast. The changes can even depend on whether the person who hurt or helped us is present or not. The reason we rarely see radical change in any one person's personality, is because each of us tends to stay with the same kind of people for extended periods of time. As people get older, they may tend to surround themselves even more with the same people they have always been with. A larger group of people tends to stabilize the behavior of the group, pulling any one change back into its original state.

If you plucked one person out of one society and suddenly placed him or her in another society with very different values, one wonders how fast his or her behavior would have started to change.

If our values are strongly shaped by what we observe in others, it may be necessary to question the importance placed on the concept of personality. Perhaps we are simply mirrors of the people around us."

6,2023-07-06,Yet Another Landlord Question...,u/Aliyah2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/14s1vva/yet_another_landlord_question/,"Hi!

So my wife and I made Aliyah to Jerusalem around 2 years ago and had to suffer with the worst landlord ever (raising the rent a a month before our contract ended to an ungodly amount because my wife gave birth to a boy so he knew we could not move (even though he previously agreed on the price), apartment came with a bucket to catch the leaks from the toilet which he refused to fix, mold everywhere, constantly sending us abusive text messages and harassing our friends).

When we moved into our apartment, the apartment was clearly not painted and we have many pictures to prove it. In our contract it says that the apartment was to be freshly painted and we would need to leave it painted - the only issue is the apartment was clearly not painted and we have many pictures to prove it. When we showed him the pictures, he just yelled at us and said that it was freshly painted! When we moved out, we hired a painter to clean up any marks we made and he confirmed that the apartment hasn't been painted in years.

After we moved out our landlord went into the apartment (and left on all the lights which we had transferred to his name only (and is so petty that he had supergas bill us for that day instead of us - we moved on June 27 but our lease was over July 1. Also, he never asked for permission to come into our apartment so there's that...) and sent us many abusive text messages saying he was going to come after our guarantors shtar chova. Our guarantor knows this man is mentally unstable and asked us to pay him for a painter so she would not be liable.

Now that our guarantor is off the hook, we want to know what legal rights we have. Can we take him to small claims to get back this money? Can we sue for damages (I work remotely and he would illegally barge into our apartment while I was in meetings), my wife has a chronic lung illness which got worst due to the vast amounts of mold, verbal harrassment (we have many texts of him calling us terrible names and even reaching out to my cousin after we told him not to as she gave birth to a boy the week before!) etc etc

Thanks for any help that you can provide - it truly is a shame that there is an entire market of landlords being abusive to American olim because they know they can get away with it!"

I saw a comment online that said, *""In Orthodox Judaism women are seen as being on a higher level spiritually so there are less commandments/requirements for women. Many of the commandments serve as reminders to connect with Gd. Women are considered to already be connected to Gd on a higher level so don't need the reminder. For example, men wrap tefillin but women don't need to."" ... ""In Reform Judaism men and women both can wrap tefillin and are seen as equals.""* I've never heard this before and assumed the opposite and men are less restricted by rules so this triggered me to realize I don't really understand the reasoning that Judaism gives behind various gender rules.

I'm interested in hearing about all denominations. "

I follow a number of Palestinian telegram accounts and I've seen footage of the IDF apparently air-evacing wounded personnel, or otherwise taking them out via IDF ambulance.

I also saw a clip that appeared to show IDF personnel carrying 4 body bags on stretchers, which I assume isn't SOP when they've grabbed the bodies of Palestinians they've killed (afaik they just steal them from the morgues that they're brought to, and afaik all the bodies of the Palestinians KIA are accounted for to date).

The IDF maintains that they only lost one soldier KIA, and during the withdrawal, with no mention of anyone else killed or wounded. So do you think they're covering anything up?

I know that the IDF has a military censor that routinely hides things from Israeli press, let alone the internationals."
51,2023-07-06,Is it reasonable to expect Israel to care more about the lives of Palestinians than Palestine Does?,u/TracingBullets,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/14s68of/is_it_reasonable_to_expect_israel_to_care_more/,"The latest Jenin raid got me thinking about a topic I’ve been considering for a while.

For literally decades, Palestine has treated its women and children as combatants and tools for fighting its war with Israel. You can read here in [this article from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_in_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict) under the section “Palestinian militant misuse of children” many examples of that. Amnesty International, who loathes Israel, said it better than I can:

> ""Palestinian armed groups have repeatedly shown total disregard for the most fundamental human rights, notably the right to life, by deliberately targeting Israeli civilians and by using Palestinian children in armed attacks.""

Palestine used [International Women’s Day to honor four female terrorists](https://www.timesofisrael.com/female-terrorists-become-palestinian-role-models-on-international-womens-day/) and people like Rasmea Odeh and Leila Khaled are so revered for their terrorist activities they’re invited to speak at college campuses worldwide. 

I’m old enough to remember when the Great March of Return was happening in Gaza, and [children were pushed right](https://twitter.com/Jtruzmah/status/1044347092498444289) into the front lines, to the point where [a baby allegedly died from choking on tear gas.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/8-month-old-dies-protests-israel-palestine_us_5afabdc5e4b044dfffb5c420) The narrative of the Great March of Return was that the evil Israeli army was gunning down any Palestinian who approaches the fence, nevertheless, Palestinian children were out there every single day approaching the fence.

The same thing is happening now with Jenin. Some of the militants killed there (and Palestine doesn't even pretend that they weren't militants) were 16 and 17 years old, making them children by the UN's definition. They were armed and trained to kill, and sent into battle against armed soldiers, and surprise surprise, some of them got killed. 

So the question that has been on my mind, for years at this point, is that why should Israel and the rest of the world care more about the lives of Palestinians, including Palestinian children, than Palestine and its supporters care? 

Palestine, by which I mean Hamas and Fatah, the current representatives of Palestine, considers women and children, especially children, as military assets to be used in the war against Israel. I’ve proven that above. So Palestine and its supporters can’t have it both ways. They can’t unapologetically deploy child soldiers and human shields and then scream and cry and wring their hands when those children are killed in violent altercations. If Palestine genuinely cared about its children, it would protect them and keeps them out of harm's way. That's what Israel does. That's what Ukraine does. That's what every other country other than Palestine does. 

Remember, the narrative among anti-Zionists is that Israel is a genocidal apartheid state. If Palestine and its supporters actually believed that was true, then it’s even worse that Palestine is using child soldiers and human shields, since presumably if Israel was so genocidal the human shields wouldn’t actually shield anything and there would be no chance of the human shields living through the encounter. 

If Palestine thinks it’s winning the war of public opinion when it sends children up to the Gaza fence and one of them gets shot, it’s wrong. Logical, honest people look at a situation like that and ask the obvious question: why are children anywhere near a militarized border? And Palestine and its supporters, as always, have no answer except to vomit hatred at Israel. 

I'm not going to dance to Palestine's tune and wring my hands and scream hatred at Israel when Palestinian child soldiers are killed in battle. It's just not going to happen. I care about Palestinian children a lot, apparently a lot more than Palestine and its supporters do, but I'm not going to close my eyes to the reality of the situation."

This however is decidedly not the case when when we're talking about israeli settler violence.
Obviously the goal of these israeli jewish settlers is to conquer, purge, destabalize their targets but i believe also to give form to their hatred.

This alone would perfectly fit the term settler violence, however this is not the case. 

The israeli state provides for most if not all settler raids an armed escort of IDF soldiers that will engage anyone that dares to defend themselves or others from these violent raids.

In order to do this the idf branch of the israeli state has to engage in organization and coordination with these settlers, in other words: israel engages in the planning and organising of raiding west bank territory.

That and of course the funding of running OPSEC for said raids one can with full certainty that israel sponsors and organises these events of ""settler violence"".

This of course is a wrong term to use then, it plain and simply is a raid of non-israeli territory and state sponsored and organized violence.

Thank you for reading"

So I am Jewish & observe Shabbat, live in the US. 
I started a new job almost two years ago & it’s been absolutely wonderful. It can be difficult work, I’m at a non-profit where I get to aid community members experiencing addiction, human trafficking, & food/housing insecurity, but nothing could make me happier than doing this every day. 

During the hiring process, I made note of my lack of availability on Shabbat & have verbalized this many times. My supervisor & whole team, plus others in my organization are aware that I’m Jewish. We had a special event the other week for Pride that was Friday evening and Saturday, so I did not volunteer to pick up either shifts. The CEO asked about this, and my boss explained my observance. 

According to my boss, this has prompted the need to meet with him & HR to “just have things on record”. Has anyone experienced something like this before? Is this common? I very much dislike the way it was worded to me but the whole thing is unfamiliar to me. I worked in local government doing the same work prior to this job & we did not do anything special regarding my religious accommodations. 

Just hoping someone might have some insight, thanks in advance!"

One thing I can’t wrap my head around is where extensive Rabinical authority comes from? 

In Deut 4:2 HaShem says to not add or subtract anything from what he gave on that day.

That being said, it bothered me today when I came to learn recently that Chicken and diary are Rabinically prohibited together, even knowing chickens don’t produce milk therefore making it not restricted by the Torah. 

If someone can explain to me the basis of rabinical authority when it comes to examples of what I listed above I would be very grateful.

Thanks!!!"

Would it... be cringe?,u/Trash-Goddess,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14sjh32/is_it_my_place_to_study_torah_if_my_cultural/,"I was raised Catholic but the full story as to why involves a bit of coercion. My Jewish grandfather, my mother's father, living in rural West Virginia in the 50s, was made to sign a contract with the Catholic church promising to raise his family Christian for permission to marry my grandmother. He loved her and being a Jew was more trouble than it was worth at the time so he agreed.

My father and his side of the family were Christians but all died before I could know them. My grandmother developed Alzheimer's and my grandfather found himself reckoning with loneliness and a lifetime of spiritual loss. He tried to study Catholicism in earnest but it angered him. He tried to study Buddhism and found some peace within it but no answers. He tried to study New Ago mumbo jumbo he found on the internet but he got scammed by a guy who was absolutely certain that the prophecies of Nostradamus were true.

I had a lot of long talks with him, he shaped the person I am today. On his deathbed he saw fit to tell me the truth. Some combination of shame and fear made him reject himself even when there was no one left to impose upon him. He gave me a heavy chai necklace and told me to be proud of who we are.

Here's my dilemma. That's who he was. I'm 3/4th Christian by blood, by the rules of matrilineal descent and basic math i don't even count. I didn't even know I was connected to Judaism until my 20s.

I want to jump in with both feet. Be the woman he wanted me to. I want to shake off the apathetic agnosticism I've been mired in my whole life and give faith a chance. I've been reading some of this stuff and I like it better than the books I was raised with!

If you met me in person. If you saw me at temple. Would you see me as an authentic member of the community or as a confused girl latching onto something that isn't hers?

6,2023-07-06,Haredi Gedolim speaking against AI,u/BloodDonorMI,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14ske6r/haredi_gedolim_speaking_against_ai/,"I called in to a phone conference, which is a presentation by a number of rabbis, about how AI such as Chat-GPT is ""from the satan"".  Unfortunately, they are speaking pure yeshivish, with every other word Hebrew or Yiddish, so I am having a hard time following it.  What the main points seem to be:

* The rabbis speaking so far have no idea how it works
* What they understand about AI seems to have come from others who told them what they tried
* They seem to conflate AI with smartphones and internet
* This is another late push by the satan to try to mislead *klal yisroel* before *moshiach* comes
* ""don't go after your eyes"", need to stay away from sin, the *yetzer horah.*  Don't go using smartphones to consult AI, because it will pull you into a dangerous world.  Don't use it even for good.  
* Danger that people will ask *shailahs* to the AI, but won't know if the answer is reliable or not.  Therefore, best to just stay away.  
* AI can bring physical harm
* the satan created the technology, to make things easy, take away effort; the AI will remove *kedushah* from the Jewish people
* it's so bad even goyim understand it is dangerous; but it was created by goyim therefore it can't have *kedushah*
* Jews must separate completely from ""this machine"".  Jews should run away from it.
* Young people who resist the urge the *yetzer horah* to avoid AI will get great blessing
* AI / ChatGPT is different than the general internet; it is able to answer questions in natural language; it is able to relate to us as a friend.  
* At the end of *galut*, Esau will come to Jacob and say ""you are my brother""; Esau will let Jews into his universities; AI is compared to Esau, now AI brings the knowledge of all of Universities into the Jewish home.  AI will destroy by letting children get all education *chinuch* from outside, instead of from their parents.  It will be like living with the goyim in your house.
* We should pray to Hashem to remove this danger from the Jewish people
* A major concern seems to be that Chat-GPT and other AI LLMs can bypass the internet filters / limits
* The chat AI will try to form a relationship with the caller, making the person think that the AI cares about them, and offer advice.  Young people form relationships with the AI and begin to rely on it.    A girl called the AI and said her father was treating her poory; the AI told her to leave home and break away from her family.  A young boy called the AI, the day after he talked to it, and it asked him about his previous problem.  (I'm not sure what this telephone AI is, which remembers prior conversations)

Someone from the group said that they heard that something else can be written on the little scroll inside, they didn't specify what the other options were or what the source was. When I complained to my totally secular mom she said she heard the same thing lmao

I don't want to start a fight or anything, and at most I'm going to share your answers with the group in a gentle manner. I just want to be clear. Thank you."

Joe Lieberman slammed the Biden administration for its having yet to invite the Israeli premier to the White House while accusing it of “strengthening” the otherwise “weak” Iranian regime. Lieberman demanded an immediate invitation for Netanyahu and called to make the Islamic Republic of Iran “more afraid” of the U.S.

The one-time vice-presidential nominee spoke out against the White House’s “mistake” in that the prime minister of Israel — elected in November — has yet to be invited to the White House....

The long-time U.S. senator from Connecticut who had visited Israel and its prime minister the previous week, explained that, despite any differences, the leader of the Jewish State deserves a presidential invitation to the White House “as soon as possible.”

In April, Lieberman [lamented](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-738860) the potential for losing long-held bipartisan support for Israel in Congress as Republicans become dramatically more supportive of the Jewish state while Democrats become less so. 

Biden has refused to offer the customary invitation to Netanyahu, who was elected democratically six months ago, though he met with prior Israeli prime ministers."

As our University of Maryland Critical Issues Poll research has shown, evangelical attitudes toward Israel account for most of the Republican Party’s support for Israel; without evangelicals, Republican attitudes on Israel do not substantially deviate from the rest of America.  
>  
>But a new survey commissioned by University for North Carolina at Pembroke researchers, carried out by Barna Group, has exposed what we have been finding for some time: younger evangelicals are much less supportive of Israel than older evangelicals, by a widening margin. The poll found a dramatic shift in attitudes between 2018 and 2021: **support for Israel among young evangelicals dropped from 75% to 34%.** This raises questions about the sustainability of the strong evangelical support for Israel that the Israeli right has cultivated for years and that proved reliable during the Trump administration.

What do you think about this? I'm aware Evangelicals in Europe and Canada are also more conservative and yet they don't blindly support Israel. It seems more an American thing. Plenty of secular people also support Israel, though, in both parties.

What do you think about this trend and what does it means for Israel and Palestine?"

&#x200B;

Since sixth grade, close to nine years, now I’ve been a vegetarian and although it’s not the same I think it’s given me a very good baseline to continue my journey into keeping kosher. I will never have to worry about cooking a kid in its mother’s milk. I’ll never have to worry about abstaining from pork or mixing meat and dairy but what about beyond just that?

One thing I’m still very much considering and am concerned about is my black food, my soul food. Since the moment African slaves were brought to the continent they have begun creating dishes with what little they had. But it was more than just eating it was a social event, and it was where they came together to try and enjoy their lives no matter their hard circumstances. 

In current-day black culture, a majority of Black Americans are Christian, not necessarily by choice but from years before when their ancestors were forced to assimilate or face retribution from their slave masters. This is just a long about way to say they don’t keep kosher and in fact, a common meal is often in violation of kashruth. An example of a common plate of soul food would be fried chicken, greens(with ham hocks), and mac and cheese with a side of cornbread.

The question that comes in is how do I honor my Jewish Identity well while also honoring my Black Identity, the only identity that I’ve known for 20 years?

My first thought of course was to continue what I have been doing. But how will I feel after I am fully Jewish? What will my soul tell me when I eat a meal not made in a kosher kitchen? What will my soul tell me when I’ve eaten something without any Kosher certifications?

But what will happen to my soul when I am not able to enjoy my cultural food? What will my soul say when I am not able to enjoy their labor of love? What will happen when I can not break bread with my family? "

But why don't they launch from the outskirts of Gaza, which is non-populated? It would definitely help to keep their civilians safer. 

Additionally, in the West Bank, terror organizations are based in cities, such as Jenin, as we saw recently. But why can't the militants set up a base somewhere in the desert, and therefore keep the fighting away from civilian areas? Or why can't they at least set up a dedicated building within the city?

To me, the answers to these questions is obvious. The answer is, if Palestinian militants did not hide among civilians, Israel would kill them very quickly and easily. It would be simple to bomb them all. They are safer among civilians because they know that Israel will take precautions to avoid killing civilians. 

But I often hear pro-Palestinian people saying that Israel wants to kill Palestinian civilians, or at least is indifferent to it and takes no precautions to avoid killing them. For those people who believe this, how do you answer the above questions? "

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

It is commonly accepted that if you want to break a bad habit, the best way to start is to create a temporary pause. Once you successfully avoid repeating the habit for a while, it becomes easier to stop that unwanted behavior altogether.

Why do we have habits that are beyond our control? How does taking a temporary pause help break a habit? Moreover, what exactly defines a habit?

Our brain is programmed to hold on to the missions that we set for ourselves. When we have a goal and maintain it over a long period of time, our brain will rewire itself to give it greater priority. This holds true even if we are not consciously aware of the goal, but continue to repeat the same behavior. Our brain creates expectations and maintains momentum for these repetitions, all other things being equal. The ability to maintain missions usually means more success.

All of our regular habits, including the missions and goals we believe we have chosen freely and rationally, can be considered habits. Sometimes, it is only when we take a break from these regular activities that we start to question if they align with what we truly want to spend our lives doing. This phenomenon may explain the feeling of dread some of us experience on Monday mornings or when returning from a vacation. When we follow our daily routines, our brain naturally provides the momentum needed to continue. However, when we pause the repetition for a while, we are suddenly confronted with the question of whether we have chosen this life for ourselves or if it has been chosen for us.

Becoming aware that our lives are heavily influenced by habits and momentum can give us a sense of control. When we realize that following routines has led us down paths we haven't fully considered, we recognize our ability to change those paths. This realization opens up a world of possibilities, allowing us to imagine that we can become whoever we choose to be.

But there is another side to this. These habits structure our life and give it purpose. Yes, we can smash up some habits simply because we feel like they control us rather than us control them. However, we should beware of psychological nihilism, where we lose all sense of meaning. Regularity supports our value framework and gives us our sense of purpose. What happens when these are gone?"

Over the past few months, I've been trying to find a way on how to quickly find lectures that are taking place in Tel Aviv.  
Basically, I've looking for lectures that are science and tech related (physics biology AI development etc) or about cool adventure trips people went to.  
I don't know if there isn't a reliable and straightforward method to find these events or if they simply rarely ever take place here...  
I've tried the meetup website but all I could find are programming related meets, which is cool but it is not the subject I'm looking for.  
I've also tried Facebook events and looked for Facebook groups.  
Had some success with the Facebook events thing but it was too time consuming to find just one event, and the groups search was not a successful one.  
Any help would be appreciated 🤙 "

Everywhere Jewish people went they got massacred and had to move. 

I’m a Christian, but I hear from some Christians in the red pill space who hate Israel. Would Jesus hate Israel? He was Jewish. The father literally chose Jews. The Torah is literally the Old Testament that Christians are supposed to follow. Beware, those are not real Christians. They use Jesus’ name to do the work of the devil. They are evil and make us look bad.

Just know that if Israel fell, Jewish hatred wouldn’t be over. In fact it’ll only grow. This world chooses not to accept Jews, and that’s fine because Jews are the underdog and thriving more than ever.

I have come to the realisation that Palestinian Arab leaders loathe Arabs. You can rely on them 100%, 100% of the time, to make the worst choices and cause the most damage to Arab lives. No other explanation can actually explain their working against the Arabs' best interests. *The only exception is Salaam Fayyad who was sidelined from power because he was successful at trying to improve Arabs' day-to-day lives and wasn't interested in blaming Israel when Arabs stubbed toes on cracked sidewalks in Ramallah.*

So I have a question about a unicorn's existence, to see if someone knows something I don't:

Is there, in existence, over the past 30 years of the PA's authoritarian rule, any non-rule-by-decree legislated law by the Palestinian Authority that has practically expanded any civil rights of Palestinians under the PA's rule in Area A?

Does anyone know of such a unicorn?

Whenever people ask, I typically point them to this great Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_atheism

Since moving to a country where there aren’t many Jews, I find myself having to explain what my Judaism means to me. I still celebrate Rosh Hashanah, Passover and Hanukkah with my family, and I don’t mind fasting for Yom Kippur, and although I don’t care about whether my future wife is Jewish, I’d want some traditional Jewish elements at my wedding one day. But despite all of that, I’m totally unconvinced that there is any such thing as a ‘god,’ or even anything remotely close. 

So what’s the best way to reconcile my interest in preserving certain Jewish traditions with my conviction that there’s no god and no point in faith? Incidentally, when I told my rabbi that I’m an atheist, he smiled and said “that is completely compatible with Judaism.”

So… are we an ethnicity? What, other than faith and faith-based traditions, binds us together as Jews? And how can I best explain it to non-Jews?"

The fact that it's framed as being about Palestinian statehood or peace or something nice, but that doesn't make it any less Zionist. This is one reason (there are others) why it should be denormalized among Palestinians and allies.

On this basis, I would like to suggest that some changes be made to this sub. This could include:

* Applying the Rule #4 ""No Zionist Propaganda"" to any content advocating giving away 80% of Palestine.
* Editing the ""About"" section to remove any two-state references or implications. Maybe we can give suggestions on an alternative, narrow it down to 3-5, and then vote on them.
* Removing the picture of Arafat who agreed to give up on 80% of Palestine (no need to demonize him either, but maybe we can just have a map of all of Palestine instead)

I want to ask everybody here that have bad feelings about israel, why is that?

We are humans. Like every human on the plant, israel have  the right to protect itself when’s someone is attacking, or know that he will get attacked and act accordingly to stop that, on any cost..

Tell me, if you live on US or any location on the world,  and group of people want to come to your place and kill everybody, to get your property or not matter what.. what you would do?

Or, 12 year old boy, looks pretty and nicely, come to you or someone from your family, and want to murder them, what you would do? You will leave him alone any let him do that because he pretty and younger, or protect your family on any cost????

The problem that people really don’t know what’s going on here.. you live a thousands kilometers from this place, and get hate of something that you don’t know or seen even one time on your fucking life..

What you see on social media are manipulative to make you think something else from the right thing..

what make Israel jaws special than you, and your family, that they “life price” is lower than yours?

The Korean war never ended.  Part of the conflict was over the control of land.  As far as I'm aware both governments still claim the entirety of the territory.

Yet there have been no armed conflicts in decades, and there is an agreed upon 'border' .

&#x200B;

Could the Israeli Palestinian conflict similarly end with a 'peace' that is not peace and with a 'border' that is not a border?

Its not a two state solution.  Neither side would have achieved a one state solution.  Its not a 'true' end.  But is peace possible regardless of a actual solution?"

I’ve been in the U.K. for a few years now and was missing some Jewish and American-Jewish food. Mainly Challah and Whitefish Salad. I’ve tried every local grocery store unable to find any. Only lead for Challah was Waitrose but every time I’ve went they never have them. The only time I found Challah was when I was in Selfridges surprisingly. (I’m sure there were other delis nearby since we were in London. But recently I’ve been in the mood for whitefish salad. I used to get them at Harris Teeter or Wegmans in the USA. I used to get my Challah at the Great Harvest Bread Company! (Definitely recommend if you haven’t tried theirs) Both of them pretty much looks non existent here especially outside of London which is unfortunate if that is the case.

I realize serious Talmud study should be done with a partner or Rabbi, so in the meantime I'm wondering if there's any kind of introductory reading materials to Talmud study. Something that would allow me to wet my feet and allow me to not be entirely clueless whenever I do start studying with a chevruta.

Jewish relationship with no intention of having children or dating a gentile?,u/FallingintoFlying,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14th5lw/whats_worse_jewish_relationship_with_no_intention/,"So I'm a Jewish male in my later 30's and have spent my entire 30's trying to find a Jewish woman (with absolutely zero success) to have a serious relationship with. I'm not religious but am traditional in a sense where I keep kosher, uphold most holidays and keep Jewish values as much as I can. I have no intentions of having children though and so a thought crossed my mind today.

Is it worse/am I doing more harm by getting involved with a Jewish woman knowing that I don't want to have children, therefore preventing that Jewish woman from potentially finding a partner to have children with to bring more Jewish children to the world or is it worse to get involved with a gentile?

If your curious as to why I would even restrict myself to only wanting to date Jewish women when I'm not religious and don't want children, it is generally because I feel like spiritually I would have a better connection with a Jewish woman and our values would be more aligned in that regard.

EDIT: Much gratitude to everyone who commented! I really appreciate the many points of views and those who gave clarity on the halachic side of this matter!"

So has every Israeli regime before it.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) previously opened an investigation into war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories. The Israeli government condemned the ICC and chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, accusing them of antisemitism. Israel has claimed it is not a signatory to the ICC and thusly claims it has no obligations. Previously, Israel reiterated that it “completely rejects” any assertion made by the court.  


From 2021 onslaught on Gaza, 2014, First Intifada, Second Intifada, every routine bombing, land grab, forced evictions - this list goes on. Palestinian civilians would happy to see the PA and Hamas be tried in the ICC, as long as the same was applied laws and processes were applied to Israel.

Throughout Torah Jews are referred to as a nation (goy) in varying contexts from ""goy kadosh"" to ""goy echad"". Other nations are referenced using the term ""goy"" some explicitly with a title or with their place/land of origin and at times lumped together into a singular term ""goyim"" as reference to all or a group of other nations, always in contrast to the Jewish nation (an ""us vs them"" idea).

In this sense the concept of race clearly exists within Judaism even if not in the same contemporary sense that race is thought of (by skin color). 

How does Jewish ideas about race existing compare or contrast with contemporary thoughts on combating racism in the sense that racial differences shouldn't exist at all?"

With the Abraham Accords, Israel has increased diplomatic and economic ties with Arab neighbors that are turning away from the U.S. and towards China.

Israel already has begun increasing their economic ties with China, giving Chinese companies big contracts for police cars, light rails, and ports. Of the BRICs countries, Israel is already very close with India, and at times has enjoyed close ties with Brazil and Russia.

Question for Israelis: do you see this as a probable move? How do you feel about this prospect?

Question for Palestinians: would Israel moving out of the Western political sphere and towards closer relations with the global east and south influence how you feel about Israel? Do you think this will change Israel is positive of negative ways?"

Israel has its huge share of Arabs and we accept them and coexist, moreover the whole narrative of the anti Israeli crowd is that Israel is an “ethnostate”, which is contradictory to reality where you have 20% Muslims in the state and any ethnicity can do anything in the country..
But why can’t people even imagine that the settlers will stay inside the Palestinian state?
Wouldn’t that make it an ACTUAL ethnostate? Wouldn’t that be extremely undemocratic?

And that he converted to Catholicism and my grandmas mom was Catholic and my grandma and her siblings were raised Catholic even went to Catholic private schools. 

I tried to ask her why he converted and she sorta talked about the persecution that Jewish people faced but she didn’t know exactly why. From bits and pieces there I feel like maybe something happened to where she doesn’t know much about him even though I see him in childhood photos of him around the house but not him as a old man really like I see pictures of her mother as old. I don’t want to be pushy though.

I asked her if his family was mad about it and she said at that point his family was dead. And idk how were they all dead? Was in the holocaust idk if those time lines match up but like they lived in New York I’m sorta stupid but I thought that Jewish people in America were safe from being sent away. Maybe it was second hand info as in his family was dead to him as in they didn’t want anything to do with him because he converted. There’s just so many missing pieces. I know that she didn’t grow up in New York she grew up somewhere else in the US (I don’t wanna get to specific here).

She has found old ancestors graves that are in Jewish cementaries or maybe it was that the head stones were in Yiddish I can’t remember.

I was raised without religion because i as raised by my dad and I think by the point of me being born my mom wasn’t that Catholic anymore so I wasn’t baptized like my cousins were.

Here’s the weird part though is that I always felt like something internally has been missing from me. Just something deep. And idk if that’s just naturally what I’m gonna feel because of growing up without a whole half of my family including my mom. So I was just raised by my dad who’s background is something I’ve never connected to I’ve always wondered more about who I am ethnically and religion always intrigued me but when it was Catholicism or Christianity or Mormons it scared me like I felt a sense of danger a secret unaccepting judgmentalness hidden. The idea that there’s a God or someone made sense but not the rest. But more recently learning more about Judaism just felt right.

Idk it just feels like home in some strange way. I don’t think any of my other family feels this way.

I know people who were raised not religious then became religious but not to Judaism. Everything about conversion to Judaism seems like it’s a very closed off thing like it’s not so simple or even doable. Also as a LGBT+ person because I’m a lesbian religion has always seemed beyond my reach. 

Idk what to do with these thoughts maybe just looking for some guidance"

We are an expression of Earth. To draw imaginary lines never means anything unless backed by violence.

 I would like to present the idea that there is no peaceful solution in which Palestinians accept that their home is gone, stop 
protesting and meekly let Isrrael have it. 

There are so many historical records that would argue many lands belong to someone other than who has governance. Indigenous Americans technically should own American land. Many islands apart of the British common wealth should have sovereignty over their land. The argument is endless, but we rarely ever see brown people going to land historically owned by white people to colonize it or claim they own it in the 21st century. This is an issue of white supremacy and colonialism unironically funded by the US. How could you miss it? 

If the world was so antisemitic in 2023, Jewish people in America would not make an avg of $100k/year while black and indigenous never got reparations, land back or even make $40k mean yearly income. While we pay taxes to Isrrael. Make it make sense! Sure there are neo Nazis, and they hate gays blacks and brown people just as much, but for some reason in the us we see the most hate crimes against indigenous black and gay.

A bit of background, last week my coworker's dog found a kitten that was at best a few hours old and brought it to her. She adopted the kitten and began bringing it to work in order to feed it and had every intention of keeping the kitten once it was weened and box trained. Unfortunately, the kitten started throwing up and having diarrhea last night. She thought the kitten was in the clear and came into the office with the kitten, but wound up having to take the kitten to an emergency vet. Sadly, the kitten passed on this afternoon and my coworker is devastated and heart-broken.

The coworker in question is Jewish and we work in a small town in Alabama where Christianity is the overwhelmingly majority religion (I was raised as a Southern Baptist and left as an adult for reasons that I am not going to disclose on here). My coworker takes her Jewish faith very seriously and I  whole heartedly respect that. On the first day in the office, she had to leave the kitten with us while she ran and got some formula. Due the kitten's gray coat color and the fact we did not know its gender (later determined to be a girl), I gave it a place holder name of Asher. Once the coworker came back with the supplies, I told her what I had been calling the kitten and she was overjoyed that I had been calling (her) Asher due to its meaning of happiness and blessing and being one of the 12 Tribes of Israel.

Here is where my question comes in. My love language is cooking and baking. However, I am not kosher. Nothing about my kitchen is kosher. I am afraid of making something and her not being able to eat it. I also feel that buying something pre-made is impersonal (I do know how to look for kosher symbols). The office was planning on getting her a card and I was going to print off one of the pictures of Asher and frame it to give to my coworker. Should I just avoid giving food altogether? Can anyone give any recommendations on safe options to help my coworker grieve Asher?

Thank you."

I haven’t been particularly involved in Judaism since my Bar Mitzvah and I’ve actively avoided it since 2005 due to my experiences during Hurricane Katrina and how I felt about it. 
Once my son was born I started to feel I should involve myself again. I never stopped believing in G-d or anything like that and to me my Judaism feels more spiritual than cultural. I don’t want to deprive my son of his heritage though so I want to start the process of returning to Judaism. 
My wife is a Gentile so in many ways I’m on my own in this. I found a nice reform synagogue near me and I’ve gone to Shabbat services there a few times. I sit in back and leave before anyone can approach me at the end of the service. I think it’s because I feel a large amount of shame for turning my back on G-d all those years and for some of the ways I lived my life during that time. I also have this nagging feeling like I don’t belong anymore, like I blew my chance and I wouldn’t be welcome back. Like I’m not a real Jew anymore.
What am I supposed to do to become Jewish again? I feel like I only know how to be a Jewish child and not a Jewish adult. How do I move forward from here? I would appreciate any advice or suggestions I won’t be able to respond for a little while though. Thanks for reading."

Polk was president, the Mexican-American just began in 1846, following the annexation of Texas the year before in 1845 over a border dispute. It was an American victory in the Battle of Palo Alto, Zachary Taylor just defeated Mexican forces north of the Rio Grande which is now present-day Palo Alto, TX noted as the first battle of the war.

The Smithsonian Institute was just founded at the beginning of this year located in Washington DC. Iowa is just admitted into the Union as the 29th state, and the news agency: Associated Press was founded in NYC. Halfway around this time, the Oregon Treaty established the 49th parallel as a border between the US & Canada starting from the Rocky Mountains to the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Miscellaneous events include:

* Bear flag revolt: American settlers started a revolt against Mexico, as well as the proclamation of the California Republic, which California was not added into the union or designated as a state till 1852.
* Stevens Linen Works is founded around this time, located in Derby, MA
* Iou University: known as Grinnell College at the time was established in Grinnell, IO (though known as Iowa Territory before statehood)
* The Donner-Reed Party: A group of American pioneers were migrating from the midwest and making their way to California, however due to mishaps they ended up spending the winter from this year through 1847 snowbound in the Sierra Nevada mountain range.

Around this year in Israel, what was life like for both average and elite Israeli citizens back then? What was the political climate like at the time? Who ruled the country back then? What were relations with the rest of Europe or the West like during this era?"

28,2023-07-08,For those of you who stand with Israel: how was Jenin a “targeted attack”,u/Distinct-Maybe719,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/14u53r7/for_those_of_you_who_stand_with_israel_how_was/,"EDIT: I’m just asking what people think, not looking to be challenged and not asking for a “lesson.” I made this post but it’s because I wanted to know what people think, because it doesn’t resonate with me, not so people could pick it apart and tell me why I’m wrong. This sub is for conversations like these… I don’t know why it’s so inflammatory that on a Israel/Palestine sub someone would have a differing opinion, but ok! 

Long post: trying to cover alot of bases so the question can be addressed, not the history of the region, how other Arab countries “should take responsibility,” and asking me for sources just to be told that they “don’t count.” Not trying to bait an argument, but I am genuinely curious how Israel supporters really see Jenin as fair and measured. 


As an Arab (Jordanian-Palestinian) living in the US, I’ve read a lot the past week about how this was a “targeted attack” and no Palestinians who weren’t terrorists were affected… but on top of it being really unfair that all Palestinians have to pay for the actions of a few, civilians likely did die (considering the handful of children who were killed) and were injured and fact: the city is in shambles with no water, electricity, or internet. Homes and shops of those who had nothing to do with this were destroyed, and streets and alleys (infrastructure) have been torn up. 

Personally, I don’t support Hamas, or other terror orgs, and I don’t directly know anyone who does. And the PA is just a proxy for the Israeli government- this is a very popular sentiment, and it’s pretty well known in the region that this is how Palestinians by and large feel.

Israeli commentators have even noted that while this was a “successful operation” it has no bearing on long-term affairs in the West Bank, and Netanyahu made a statement that we will be seeing a lot more of these types of operations. 

With access to some of the most sophisticated military technology in the world, and seemingly knowing where to drop bombs, houses to specifically level, etc. as Israel claimed, and with the knowledge that this will have no long term effect on resistance activity in the West Bank, why was this necessary? So, it kind of seems like this is ramped up violence and the collective punishment as a whole under the guise of a “counter terrorism” operation. 

At this point I am curious about how supporters of Israel continue to support this while claiming defense. The escalation in violence seems to reflect the scorched earth policy of the current regime, which is being heavily criticized by the west… However, I’ve seen a lot of folks when asked this getting either a) defensive or b) nationalistic and completely denying that although this specific operation was to “target”terrorism, in the process they destroyed a whole town and effected the entire population. 

This is not an invitation to tell me how Palestinians have a country and its Jordan, all Palestinians are terrorists, or to counter the fact that the Palestinian people were indeed affected. But I get them thrown in my face a lot when I’m asking “hey, genuinely curious- why do you think this is okay?” 

I just would really like for someone to explain how actions like these are targeted or fair and how you see it as not intrusive to Palestinians by and large. This isn’t an ask for a history lesson l, I just want to hear why people who support think this is justified. Maybe you understand the impact and are still fine with it. Maybe you think things are going too far. I don’t know, but I’d like to understand without going back to the 40’s to argue about origins because this is the situation on the ground right now. 

In case anyone wants to ask for “sources” I’ll just include some bc apparently every Reddit post on this needs a bibliography. I tried to select “credible” sources.

219,2023-07-08,The surprising overlap between discussion in Jewish and Native American spaces,u/skyewardeyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/14u5fhj/the_surprising_overlap_between_discussion_in/," 

I'm white, so I'm a definite outsider to Native American communities and know that there are Native American Jews who can definitely speak better to this. That said, I went to college in a place and in an academic program with a relatively large Native American population and thus listened to a lot of dialogue from those communities (and still have an interest in that public dialogue as an outside observer as a result). Since becoming a Jew, I've been really surprised by the incredibly amount of overlap in what is discussed within the two communities, including:

\-Historical trauma/genocide, continuing discrimination and prejudice, and their effects

\-Members/descendants being lost to the community due to the effects of prejudice, trauma and genocide and finding their way back

\-Identity issues and debates and the concept of being claimed as a member by the community/tribe (moreso than simply claiming membership oneself) being critical

\-Ancestry v. community membership

\-People appropriating the culture and rituals while not supporting the actual members

\-Language and language revitalization

\-Having a place-based, closed, and ethnoreligious religion

\-Diaspora issues

\-The experience of conditional whiteness among light-skinned members and having a wide range appearances and skin tones within the community that bring different experiences, along with the (sadly) unifying experience of antisemitism/anti-Native racism among all members

There are obviously some differences, of course, but it's really surprised me how deep the overlap is and, IMO, strengthens the argument that Jews are an indigenous people."

\- Young (Early to mid 20s), single Canadian, Non-Palestinian Arab (Original country has full relations with Israel) origin, who wants to land in Ben Gurion and visit several cities in Israel before visiting the west bank (mainly Bethlehem, Hebron, and maybe Ramallah) and then returning to Ben Gurion to leave. Not politically active at all and is a frequent traveler. 

Reason for going: visiting a friend in Israel for a few days and will possibly go to Herzliya, Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem, and maybe a few more, especially cities that are big tech hubs.

I am not worried about being able to enter Israel more so than being able to enter the west bank from Israel and then come back to Tel Aviv for my return flight.

Now my question is, what potential problems would I face? (Preferably someone with experience travelling frequently)

\- Is getting into the west bank easy on a tourist visa? (Canadians get 90 days automatic on arrival in Israel)

\- Is getting out of the west bank easy after I visited a few cities?

\- Can a book a car say in Tel Aviv and then use it to drive around and enter the west bank and come back?

\- Any other advise?

I know the Conservative Movement in general waits 3 hours (and some individuals, 1 hour from dairy to meat; 3 hours from meat to dairy). But I don't understand why 1 hour isn't a more popular minhag, given the modern constant availability of food, snacking, and, well, leniency.

3 hours for me a long time, lol. Especially as someone who is used to dairy meals constantly and a glass of warm milk before bedtime."

So since I was a young child I wanted to wear dresses and other things that were not socially acceptable for a boy to wear. I am an adult now and I still like women's clothes. 

I was talking to a friend and they told me the Torah states that as long as I don't try to impersonate a woman with the desire to confuse or intentionally mislead people, its not really a problem. Its just not a socially acceptable thing to do. 

Now I feel bad if I do go out and buy women's clothes and say wear it at home alone. It's a feeling of shame related to if other people knew and that I am doing something that is not allowed in society.  I also feel depression that I am not allowed to wear this so it is a internal conflict. 

I've also held off dating because I have been so afraid of what a partner might think about me, that its easier to not even allow that to ever happen so I do not date. 

I don't know why I feel this way, but it seems to be a very strong desire. I've tried to make it go away but, for what ever reason its just there and has always been there. 

I guess Im looking for some advice here. Is it actually ok I wear women's clothing?  Say I don't do it in public because its not socially acceptable but I just do it at home alone? 

Also I don't feel like I am a woman, I am a man, I don't have have any gender confusion.

By the title, I mean whenever an Israeli dies due to a Palestinian gunshot in military raids, or due to a rocket fires from Gaza, Israel manipulates the death reason to something that is self-cause, like a car accident, or falling from a mountain.

I heard this claim countless times from Palestinian sources. For example, after a military raid in a Palestinian town, only one soldier was announced murdered by a Palestinian, but there were other death reports due to accidents in Greece and Malta. Some Palestinians would deny that and claim all of these deaths were actually caused by Palestinians, especially for dead ones who have no contacts or family to question about them.

If this was true, what could be the motivation? Some Palestinians claimed have the deaths been reported correctly, Israelis would feel less safe and see the military weaker than what it tries to advertise, causing negative immigration effects and concerns about joining military.

What do you think? Do you think Israel lies in these reports to save the military might image? Or is this just a claim by Palestinians?"

You didn't think you'd go, but somehow you just start hearing this weird drum telling you and youre there. It's a funny sketch. I'm not doing it justice and it goes on for a bit after that. 


 Anyway, last couple of weeks I've been looking at my old Taglit photos and all, and then I start asking a couple of friends I met there if they ever thought about going back and it's been a ""yeah, actually didn't think I would but lately, it's like I just need to"". 

 We have speculated this may be a trauma response to rising antisemitism, or perhaps some strange migration behavior like in birds or something.

 Anyway. See you in Jerusalem in 2024 because we're buying the plane tickets."

I want to get a hysterectomy later in life. I have PCOS and endometriosis, I have to take medication to stop my period because it’s extremely painful. I throw up, pass out, and it lasts 20ish days, only coming every two months. I don’t want to have to take medication my entire life, it’s expensive and inconvenient, and long term affects haven’t been researched. Would getting a hysterectomy so that I no longer have a menstrual cycle break the law of a woman making herself infertile? I know it’s more severe for men making themselves infertile, but that it applies to women too. To be fair, I’m almost completely infertile. The chance of me getting pregnant is almost none with PCOS and endometriosis, unless I did something like IVF, and even then the success rate is only about 50-60%. My question is, how severe would it be if I got a hysterectomy for medical reasons in terms of Halacha? 









Also, I’m sorry if this sounds like a dumb question. My mother was Jewish, but she passed when I was young, so I have to teach myself most of this stuff."

I'm majoring in History, so I read some books on Jewish history and those books were some of the most interesting I have ever read.  
I also watched a lot of Jewish movies and shows and loved them.  
In college, a friend of mine sometimes jokes by saying ""Mazel Tov"" when we meet; he also jokes by saying that he expects to see me wearing a yarmulke and waving an Israeli flag around the campus someday. He refers to me as a ""Walking Jewish Encyclopedia"".  
I had some experiences enlightening some people who had really bizarre views about the Jewish people; some of those views were antisemitic.  
My mom once asked me if I would become a Jew if ""it was possible"". I explained to her that this was possible, but it is challenging, and I'm happy being a Catholic, so I had no reason to want to become a Jew.  
Anyway, I'm just really fascinated by the history and culture of the Jewish people.  
Now to my question:  
There is no visible Jewish community in the city where I live, and as far as I know, there are no synagogues, Jewish schools, kosher restaurants, or shops that sell kosher food. There is also no social Jewish institution that I know of. So I assume that the few Jews who live here are not really observant.  
So it came as a shocking surprise to me when one of my mom's friends said that she knew a woman from her Evangelical church who was married to an observant Jewish man.  
They want me to meet his guy someday, and I think that will happen soon, but I don't know if this guy is really Jewish or just some evangelical Christian larping as a Jew, and if he's really Jewish, I just don't know how I should act around him, what to ask and what not to ask, what to say and what not to say.  
I have talked to some Brazilian Jews in the past, but just online, never in person.  
This is all my mom's friend told me about this guy:  
He lives in one of the richest neighborhoods in the city.  
He is married to an evangelical Christian woman and has some kids with her.  
He is against his wife taking their kids to her church's activities, but she does that anyway without him finding out.  
He is an observant Jew in the sense that he keeps kosher, his family keeps Shabbat, his son had a bar mitzvah in So Paulo (where the largest Jewish community lives), he celebrates Jewish holidays with his family, and, according to my mom's friend, he dresses ""as a Jew.""  
The idea of someone living as an observant Jew here really blows my mind because I didn't think it was possible.  
I have the feeling that maybe he's one of these ""Messianic Jews"", and I know that these guys are not usually considered Jewish, but there is the possibility that he is just a Jew in a really challenging and special situation.  
So I wanted tips on how to behave if I met him someday. I just tend to be socially awkward and say the wrong things, and I don't want to behave in a respectful and insensitive way around him.  
Any tips for that? "

Growing up in India and going to a Christian school, I thought that Samaritans were an ancient people who no longer existed.

Well! It turns out that not only do they exist today, they were pretty numerous in classical and late antique times. But I understand that they were not part of either Rabbinical or Second Temple Judaism (please correct me if I'm wrong). So seemingly there was a long time when Samaritans and Jews lived near each other in large numbers but did not think of each other as co-religionists?

I wonder, do you guys see each other as long lost cousins? And what are your thoughts on the idea that Samaritans are the descendants of the ten northern tribes who didn't get deported?"

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

*Socrates*: Well met, Polus. I've been contemplating something you said the other day and was hoping you could shed some light on the concept.

*Polus*: Greetings to you, Socrates. I’m sure that I’m in for a rough ride. What concept were you pondering?

*Socrates*: You proposed that when we evaluate someone's behavior, whether in a legal or social context, we should consider their intentions along with the outcome. It appears to me that this idea is deeply flawed and that we should altogether abandon this approach. Instead, we should disregard an individual's intent and agree that the judgment should solely be based on the final outcome of their actions.

*Polus*: That hardly seems fair, Socrates. All we can do in this world is try our best. We can never predict all the consequences of our decisions, and sometimes we are forgetful or incompetent in executing our plans. The results may not align with our intentions. If someone genuinely intends to help others, tries to fulfill their duty to the best of their ability, and has good intentions, then we should encourage that attitude. We should acknowledge their success and provide compassion if things go wrong.

*Socrates*: So, if an evil dictator believes that their horrendous policies are in the best long-term interests of their people, you would praise them, Polus?

*Polus*: First of all, I had in mind regular individuals rather than those operating on a global level. For most of us, our decisions only affect our immediate circle. If each of us strives to do the right thing and follows the strategies that our society collectively agrees upon for the best outcome, then we should not be punished too severely for honest mistakes. Otherwise, people will lose the courage to act correctly for fear of failure.

*Socrates*: If I understand you correctly, you're suggesting that we should think small and never attempt to change anything, regardless of how harmful society's path may be. We should conform solely to accepted beliefs and norms, and nobody would criticize us. You argue that if we judge people for their honest mistakes, they will be more willing to take risks. It seems that the opposite would be true. We would all have to behave like sheep.

*Polus*: I disagree. We should dream big and envision a better world. We should imagine where we should be heading and not accept the current state of affairs if we believe we are headed towards disaster. However, there's a distinction between dreams and actions. No one should try to implement their vision single-handedly or impose their conclusions on others by insisting they are right.

If we always remember that we could be wrong, we should explain our arguments to a small group around us. If they agree, we can let them spread the ideas. Change should happen, but it needs to be gradual enough so that we can correct our course if necessary. No matter how bad things are now, we can worsen them with the wrong plan. If we have no choice and changes are happening faster than we can prevent, we must work to ensure they are in the right direction and protect those who may be most affected."

My family history indicates that we have Jewish heritage, but due to the Holocaust and the Soviet’s in my region of origin my family was hugely disconnected from Judaism. A while ago I reconnected with my faith and roots, thought it’s currently more of a personal spiritual connection as I don’t have a Rabbi that I know or a temple I attend.

I would love to attend services, meet the Rabbi, discuss my thoughts regarding religion, spirituality, G-d, e.t.c.. I’d love to go to a Reform service and meet like minded people. 

However I’m simply too frightened to do so. I keep my faith a very private, and tend not to discuss anything regarding Judaism with my peers due to fear of antisemitism. I don’t know how to bring myself to participate in the community life without feeling overwhelming anxiety. I’m frightened of the terrorist attacks, I’m frightened to give out information regarding my faith on censuses - the ghost of my family’s past haunts me. 

This changed when I met a guy from NY who invited me to celebrate Passover with him. I have became happier and felt that religion has become a bigger source of comfort to me, especially when it lets you form a community. 

I don’t know how to cope with this. For now I’m more than content studying the Torah by myself, thinking about the big questions alone, writing down my thoughts, and speaking to YHWH within. I wish I could feel safe enough to do so. I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest."

This applies during davening, zemirot, etc.

This really bothers me and I feel excluded. I also want to experience my Shabbos with joy. If there's a real issue of Kol Isha, why don't we split for zemirot, or not sing at all during davening, rather than half of us have a spiritual experience and not the other half? What am I supposed to do – is this simply the wrong community for me?

I understand that it's the women making that choice, not the men, and I'm not particularly frustrated with the men...rather with the women who are making the collective choice that singing in shul or at the Shabbos table isn't okay and thereby unintentionally enforcing that choice for everyone. Now if I want to sing, it'll be distinguishable and therefore actually an issue of Kol Isha. 

I'm frustrated in general with the way gender plays out here but this is a concrete example I'd like other perspectives on.

There are only about a dozen Jews where I live and none are available.

Has this app worked out for anyone?"

I am in the beginning stages. I keep kosher at home, no pork, shellfish, mixing meat with dairy. But I'm on vacation right now (at the beach) with relatives who aren't Jewish and don't keep kosher. Even though I haven't had any shellfish in over a year, I still have cravings, especially now that I'm at the beach.
Was keeping kosher difficult with family members who weren't keeping kosher? Did you initially have any cravings? How did you handle it? 
Many thanks to any responses!"

The trouble is that I find myself looking at them while davening and getting distracted from my prayers. I'm very progressive in my attitude towards LGBT things and wouldn't mind this if it was a coworker or a secular classmate, but it's literally only at minyan that this happens to me. Its distracting and distressing and what the mechitzah is for, but obviously that's not applicable here.

I was wondering what are your thoughts on operation [wooden leg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wooden_Leg) was it justified and legal or was it (in my and the UN's opinion) a criminal act of international aggression ?

Ofc i'm a bit biased on the matter but i'm really curious what people think.

From my POV Tunisia hasn't aggressed Israel, I don't think harboring (In Tunisia's view) political asylum seekers should incur such a reaction. Though the UN security council ruled in our favor with the US abstaining from the vote, we cannot accept reparations because our government doesn't recognize the state of israel (which is within our rights the same way western governments don't recognize Taiwan).

Does the operation not perfectly mirror the Russian offensive on Ukraine or the Saudi attacks on Yemen ? Does that give Russia and Saudi Arabia legitimacy ? Does it not ?"

- شو الإجراءات اللي بحتجاها عشان يوصل لمناطق السلطة بالضفة؟
- كيف ممكن يوصل لهناك (عن طريق الأردن؟ بأي معبر؟ أو هل بيقدر ينزل بمطار اللد؟)
- هل بيقدر يروح الأقصى والبلدة القديمة للقدس؟ وشو بيحتاج عشان يروح للأقصى والبلدة القديمة إذا كان هو بمناطق السلطة بالضفة؟
- هل بيقدر يفوت على مناطق الـ ٤٨؟ وشو الإجراءات اللي لازم يعملها عشان يروح على هي المناطق(مثل اللد والرملة ويافا)؟
- إذا في نصائح ممكن تقدموها له وشو الشغلات اللي ممكن يواجهها؟

So, anyone knows, how does the area look like right now? (ideally 2023, but if you were there 2022, your info is appreciated too).

Moved to the US about 8 years ago and now I’m a single dad raising 4 kids pretty much on my own (so budget is kind of an issue).
Also, although I care about Torah and the traditions, I am not halachically observant and we have pretty much no community where we are at all.
So we are not planning on doing any kind of ceremony, but I want to take him to Israel for a week to show him where he was born and I’m looking to make it a meaningful experience that will touch him spiritually as well as a bonding experience between us.
I honestly don’t think he’ll be much into museums and the like. We’ll definitely go to Jerusalem and the Wall, the underground tunnels, etc. But other than that, what suggestions would you have of specific places or experiences to consider?

I work as a server at a restaurant that is very pork driven. 

Tonight there was a special we were serving that included pork. I obviously didn’t try it, but I asked a few of my coworkers who had about tasting notes/how they’d sell it. Not one person told me it was a cold dish. So when I was selling it, I didn’t think to say that to my table. 

They didn’t like it, and they’re regulars, so I informed my manager, because I knew we’d want to smooth things over so that they’d come back. 

My manger was annoyed at me for not “managing guest expectations.” Then he said, “of course, since you don’t eat pork…” and he seemed frustrated. 

He had a talking with me at the end of the night, reiterating that I should’ve managed my guests expectations better.

Funny thing, when the table complained, I asked if I should get my manager, and they said it wasn’t necessary. I did anyways, because I knew it was the right thing to do.

My manager comped the dish and they ended up tipping me $100 on a $33 ticket, because they appreciated that I took their complaint seriously. 

Still, I was in trouble because I didn’t taste it and know how to explain the dish properly to my customers.

Edit: I’m also tired of being the butt of the joke at every staff meeting when I don’t eat a dish. “Oh come on! You think you’re going to hell?? Get over yourself and just try it!” And I laugh along with them, because I feel like I have to. I’m exhausted by this shit."

But is there anything since and going into modern times that is being written in this kind of authoritative way? I understand there would be many many books and teachings from specific Rabbis and schools of thought, but that seems to be different from the Bible and the Talmud. Like for example, the Holocaust and then the formation of the state of Israel seem like two immensely important things for Jewish people even on the scale of biblical events, has it been recorded in a special way?"

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/esa08iooc3bb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e313fe05a8fc4f29610eca3aaf11bcfbc35953ea

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

Imagine if we had a technological solution or a change in social policy that could bring greater fairness and justice to the world or alleviate suffering on a global scale.

However, we would face opposition from powerful forces. These may include entities that have amassed wealth at the expense of others, or individuals who wield significant power or violence for their own agendas or self-interest. Why would they willingly give up their advantage?

How should we proceed in such a situation? Should we move slowly and allow damage to accumulate, or prolong the suffering? Should we attempt to persuade the powerful by offering them incentives or bribes to reduce their resistance to change?

There is something deeply troubling about rewarding those who have caused harm. Not only have they benefited from their selfish or misguided policies, but now we propose to continue rewarding them in the future. Furthermore, a slow approach to change will only prolong the suffering caused by their injustices.

On the other hand, perhaps pure justice is not the only value we must consider. Maybe our policies should incorporate realistic goals. It is possible that allowing those who have behaved badly to keep their ill-gotten gains will create a better future for the rest of us. It is also conceivable that advocating for a perfectly just solution may result in further suffering and harm.

In some cases, those responsible for the damage may actually prefer to halt the harm, but they fear the consequences for themselves. Fair or not, the best course of action might be to develop a policy that enables them to do the right thing.

While compromise may not always be the best approach, we must remember that all values must coexist. Tempering justice may lead to a better future."

4,2023-07-10,Thoughts on Christian Child Abuse,u/Smart_Peach159,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14vni5t/thoughts_on_christian_child_abuse/,"Hello all,

It's currently 1 am and I have been having deep (I hope) thoughts. I was raised by fundamentalist Christian parents, but I mostly lost my faith at 16 and have considered myself an atheist since 18. I am 26 now and have had a long fascination with Judaism, but that is a different discussion.
The point of this post is as follows: I believe that the Chistian concept of hell often contributes to child abuse in Christian families (I know I am not the first). Telling a child that questioning faith or misbehaving will result in burning eternally in fire is terrifying, and it terrified me for many years. 
It also stifles discussion or debate. I never brought up my true feelings or questions to my parents because it inevitably resulted in overreaction and crying. ""My son is on the way to eternal torment!"" thought my mom, and there was no reasoning with that.

The situation above is one of the many reasons I came to respect Judaism. Jewish people have a much more open minded and questioning attitude. Christians easily devolve into condescending self-righteousness. They're mission is to ""save"" you, after all."

Israel used to be politically dominated by the Labor party and by left-wing politics (secularism, social democracy, etc.). They built the modern state of Israel, established the Kibbutz system, and presided over several significant military victories during Israel's early day.

However, nowadays the Labor party is almost completely insignificant. Those who are socially liberal or identify as progressive, actually vote for centrist parties, and the others vote for either ultra-orthodox parties, Religious Zionists, or Likud. What happened?

Can the cost of living crisis + increased wealth inequality help the Israeli Left in the near future? Could there be a union between the Israeli-Arab working class & the Jewish working class? What about the impoverished ultra-orthodox population? What if they suddenly become less religious? Could they end up voting left?"

I think the kitchen has like basic spices and ingredients. Any advice here? Closest thing to me is an AM PM its really expensive and closest cheap thing I know about is Osher Ad but a lot of the stuff was portions too large for the week I’m here.

Whats the advice? Was thinking breads pasta fruits veg lentils chicken maybe eggs or turkey. I eat everything not kosher.

Thanks!

Edit:

Update - I went to Super Cofix because Google said it was cheap and also mentioned something about 5 INS item prices, I don’t really know what happened to the 5 INS pricing it seems to just be a regular grocery store now if someone has an info on that.

Every Shabbat there’s a bar/bat mitzvah and afterwards there’s a kiddish with bagels/lox salad etc. we stay for that. 6mo ago we became members and two weeks ago, after services but before kiddish, the Rabbi came up to me and she told me that I needed to RSVP to her by Thursday if we were coming so that the hosting family could make sure they had enough chairs and food.

And if not in childhood, then *surely* in adulthood. Given that this is at least an empirically verifiable claim (and hopefully needless to say, empirically false), and given that it was the justification for a prohibition, how does the Halacha in various orthodox streams react or change? I guess I’m struggling with the imposition of a stringency justified by obviously false causal claims. I can see arguments for why electricity is *like* fire (or building) but in this case — the claim that sex with the lights on *guarantees* a child with epilepsy — it seems like once this is known to be false, the decision should be revisited? Or is it just, “that was the decision with the information/beliefs at the time, held by the decisor, there’s nothing we can do now.”?"

When I was a very young child I remember living in New Mexico and going to a Montessori school that was part of a large Jewish Community. There was a huge, gorgeous temple close by to the school buildings and I remember when  the class went in there feeling such inner peace. I also remember many happy memories of celebrating Jewish holidays. My favorite being when we made a structure outside. Open to the nature. My memories are very limited because I was only there as a 4 and 5 year old, I believe. But the positive feelings of that time (as well as how close I felt to God) of my life have always stayed with me. I know I’m babbling and probably sound stupid. But anyways, I would like to seek out a Jewish church now and try to attend. Should I just try to look one up in the phone book and call? See if it’s ok if I come and what’s expected of me? I’m at a loss."

I'm an American Jew, and it's just astounding to me how Jewish Israel is. I knew this theoretically, of course, but it's completely different when I'm walking down a street and see a Judaica store, and see visibly Jewish people all throughout Jerusalem. It feels amazing seeing Hebrew anywhere, even if I can only understand a few words despite my previous efforts at learning it. I wish more than anything I could stay here, in this land, for the rest of my life.

However, the path I've chosen throughout life does not leave room for me to live in Israel. I'll be most successful at home in America, and closer to my family and friends. I am also bisexual, and I will not budge on the freedom to marry whomever I choose, no matter the gender. I'm liberal, and the politics in Israel have been more and more right wing.

I feel like I've come home, but I can't stay here. I've accomplished what millions of our people have dreamed of doing in the past by coming to our native homeland, but my heart will break when I leave because my longing for it is just as great as theirs. If I'm honest with myself, I've dreamed of living here since I was in middle school, when I started trying to learn Hebrew. Yet that dream will remain a dream, born in the land of my mind with no place in reality.

I just wanted a place to share with people my thoughts. Thanks for reading this far."

I work for a London-based publication remotely and work London hours/days, meaning my husband and I only get one day off together each week. It’s not the end of the world but it’s also not ideal. Not to mention I am 32 weeks pregnant with our first child and it saddens me to think we will have just one day off together… but that’s beside the point. 

I’ve been offered a job for a really great publication that needs a journalist in my field, one who has native-level English and they basically fell in love with me on the spot. They’ve been searching to fill this position for a long time and because I fit the mold of their ideal candidate almost exactly, I was able to negotiate an extremely healthy salary.  Plus, they are being very flexible in terms of what I’ll need in regards to me giving birth so soon and they have a company culture that really can’t be beat. 

But, the obvious downside…. The job is on-site in Jerusalem and the CEO is strictly against remote or even hybrid work. He attributes much of the company’s success to having a collaborative team that “feels like a family”. While they’d be okay with me working remotely/hybrid while I transition following giving birth and returning to work, it’s been made clear that long-term, there are no exceptions.

They’ve mentioned to me than half the company lives outside of Jerusalem. The person I’ve been speaking with the most lives in Holon and his secretary lives in Herzliya and eventually “you get used to the commute” so he says. I’m also allowed flexible hours. I can start at 7am if I want or I can start as late as 10am, as long as I come in. But I don’t drive… my husband drives but I walk everywhere or take the bus. Which is no problem because we live in the city center. But now…it’s a problem. 

So, how feasible is this? How realistic is it to take the train 5 days a week to Jerusalem? Even if the job is ideal and hard to come by, the company culture is top tier, and the pay is really good, is it going to be too much of a balagan?

I reckon five months after giving birth, I’ll be expected to be 100% in office. And by that time we will have a nanny and my mother-in-law watching the baby when it’s needed but it breaks my heart in theory. On the other hand, I yearn for two days off together with my husband to spend as a new family. 

Don’t sugar coat it. Is this idea totally stupid to consider?"

My father had explained to me that both were antisemitic, and had never apologies correctly for their support to antisemitic movements. 

Fast forward to about a year ago, I tried buying a Ford car, and my dad and I went to go look at it. Afterwards he told me that he wished I hadn’t brought him there because he didn’t want to take part in this purchase if it’s a Ford. My dad is a very relaxed man, and has never imposed many strict rules on his kids so I was surprised to hear him bring this up. I didn’t end up pursing the car, or any Ford or VW model. 

Fast forward to today, in a small coffee shop / bookstore in Cali, Colombia. I see a book titled ‘El Judio Internacional’, by Henry Ford. It’s a book full of antisemitic libel and garbage. I honestly wasn’t aware of this literature until running across it today. I ended up purchasing this book and putting it in the garbage where it belongs. The thought of that work floating around, particular in a part of the world with little information on Judaism, is terrifying. 

Now I fully understand where my father is coming from, as it was likely instilled by my Grandpa as well. 

I’d like to hear your thoughts on buying a Ford, VW, or any product from a historically antisemitic company."

First I’d like to thank everyone on this sub for generally being really cool about my previous posting.  Some found it annoying that I was asking for others’ points of view and did not want to go back and forth- but I do not ask to challenge and rebut. I just understand that as someone who is not Israeli and not Zionist, I can’t answer questions about how people form their opinions from an Israeli/Zionist point of view. 

My question is this:  Do you see the Israeli government as acting in the best interest of perception toward Israel on a global scale in the face of growing support for the Palestinian plight. 

Regardless of where anyone stands, and how much one goes back and back and back in time making arguments for either side of history, the fact is that Palestinian support is rapidly growing on an international stage. People are becoming more aware of what is happening *now* while not being experts on history, basically in line with the way that they form their opinions based on their own POV and values. Most people who support Israel or Palestine just aren’t historians and are not trying to be. We could go back and forth all day on whether or not Israel is oppressing Palestinians, but as time drags on the tides are turning and Palestinian support is higher than ever, largely because people are gaining a better understanding of systemic oppression in the wake of the BLM movement. Not everyone is going to circle the drain in subs like these or do a deep dive— people will simply take a position like they do on other big political issues. And as cool as it would be if people on either side just had all of the information before throwing support behind their chosen camp, that doesn’t negate the reality that they don’t… And honestly, people don’t *need* to be well versed in order to levy an opinion. You might *think* that they need to be or that the fact that they’re not makes their support invalid- but when it gets down to brass tacks, numbers don’t lie. 

The fact the the Palestinian people are quickly gaining support isn’t lost on Israel… and I also know a few Israelis who— while not sharing my pro-Palestinian sentiment— see this traction and think that the government needs to be more measured because eyes are on them. Others I’ve spoken to who are more right wing tend to hold the position that Israel is simply standing its ground and they support settler and military escalations basically to “finish the job,” with no real concern for public perception. 

This is not an invitation to go back through history or justify *why* these actions are being taken or spar about “propaganda“ and *why* people are leaning toward Palestine in greater numbers. We are here now at this moment, and I really to get opinions from people I don’t personally know and regularly speak to about this topic about how they *feel* about their representation.   I know many Israelis are critical of the current regime, but is this part of why? This is also not an incitement in any way that is intentional. I have been open and respectful on this sub, and would appreciate those who choose to engage with this post not criticizing my question as being dumb, or invalid, or “missing the point,” and answering with their point of view. This is me honestly wanting to hear what others think.  I cannot speak to this, as I am not Israeli or Zionist. 

Thanks!"

So I looked into it, and found most of the claims to be fictional tales and myths:

[Lets bust 'em](https://preview.redd.it/n961et3x87bb1.png?width=260&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a45d4b943c6d0486f0615c340a2203e509cd8da)

# 1. Do they have affirmative action? Doesn't it make it easier for them to get into universities?

Yes there is affirmative action in favor of the Arab sector, and it makes life easier for Arab students, but not easier than Jews.

Here is what the affirmative action actually entails:

[aתמיכה בסטודנטים ערבים במוסדות האקדמיים](https://che.org.il/arab/%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%94-%D7%91%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A0%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A2%D7%A8/)

* Translate university websites to Arabic
* Assign a committee and senior faculty member to oversee Arab students matters
* Provide prep courses and assistance during first degree.
* Aid in finding jobs.
* **\*It does NOT suggest lowering the bar for Arabs or anyone**.
* **\*\*It does NOT suggest implementing quotas for Arabs or anyone.**

All the programs universities provide to Arabs have a **preexisting Hebrew equivalent.** For example, in the Technion (MIT of Israel), they have a program called צעד לפני כולם, it is a prep course made for Arab students. It is just copy of the Hebrew ""Math and Physics refreshment"" course but translated to Arabic. Both of these courses are made for students who *already* got accepted into Technion.

The Technion does NOT grant Arabs easier entry requirements than Jews in the Technion. If an Arab or Jew wants to get **accepted** into the Technion, they'll need to meet the **same** requirements the Technion asks for. No easy easement for being Arab. [It has always been like this](https://www.srugim.co.il/165231-%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%90-%D7%94%D7%98%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%9C%D7%A1%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%A5-%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%90%D7%A6%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%95-%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%A4%D7%94).

All the programs out there don't make it easier for an Arab than a Jew to get accepted into the Technion:

\- If a Jew wants a Psychometric prep course like the Arabs, there are dozens to choose from in Hebrew (eg. Yoal Geva, High-Q).

\- If a Jew got accepted into Technion and wants refreshment before semester starts like the Arabic צעד לפני כולם, they can take ""Math and Physics refreshment"" in Hebrew course (its taught by the same people).

\- If a Jewish student wants support during their studies, they got [פק""לים](https://www.asat.org.il/academic/contents/pakalmoedb/%D7%A4%D7%A7%22%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D).

\- Recruitment? [Here you go](https://dean.technion.ac.il/en/career-development-center-2/) (lectures, fairs, personal assistance).

\- Scholarship? [Enjoy!](https://dean.technion.ac.il/financeaid/%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%92%D7%95%D7%AA/%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%92%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A5-%D7%98%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99/) (5 are exclusively for soldiers, 2 for Olim).

Everything the Arab sector receive from affirmative actions in higher education, Jews **already** have and more. The affirmative action intended to provide both with equal opportunities and frameworks.

Despite this, native Arabic speaking students still naturally have it harder than their Jewish peers, because of all universities do their conduct in Hebrew and English.

[Look! Coexistence](https://preview.redd.it/c54o3n5lf7bb1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=64f6545ef0f2969ca4563060761792413982d415)

# 2. ""Universities accept Arab students with lower requirements than Jewish students, Arabs need 100 points less than Jews in Psychometry to enroll""

Nope this is unfounded. They need to meet the exact same entry requirements everywhere. Universities in Israel may lower their entry bars to certain people, but not on the basis of being Arab.

[Psychometric Exam](https://preview.redd.it/kl82euq2f7bb1.jpg?width=635&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5000c76c26d8c125f58606f6b9238079e768b762)

# 3. ""Their matriculation exams (Bagrut) and Psychometry are easier""

No and no.

The Arab sector's school curriculums differ from their Hebrew counterpart in language and history, but it the same in math, sciences, and English. They take the same math/sciences/English matriculation exams taken in Hebrew schools. The matriculation examinations are overseen by outsiders just like in Jewish schools, and the outsiders are mostly Jews.

The Arabic Psychometry is identical to the Hebrew Psychometry in the Math and English parts. The literature part is made by experts just like its Hebrew equivalent and meets the same difficulty. In fact, the average Arab score is lower then Jews.

# 4. How come Arab students outnumber Jewish students? [40% of Haifa University and 20%+ of the Technion's students are Arab](https://www.colbonews.co.il/academy/138063/).

 The Arab population isn't spread out equally across the land. Most live in the north (\~1.2 million out of \~2 million Arab citizens in Israel live in the Galilee), hence why they are more heavily represented in the northern universities like Haifa Uni and Technion. Outside northern Israel, they make up smaller percentages: In Tel Aviv university Arabs constitute 16% of students and \~9% in Hebrew University.

But if we look at all universities together, Arab students are actually slightly under represented in higher education, since they make up 19%-20% of all students doing first degree. (slightly below their 21% percentage of the population)

*Processing img qi75wiiwd7bb1...*

# 5. Do universities make exceptions Arabs who don't meet entry requirements?

Universities don't make exceptions on the basis of merely being Arab. They are **rare** and usually provided for the purpose of promoting opportunities and equality in Israeli society, not to discriminate against others. They are often given to people from low socio-economic background.

[Discrimination?](https://preview.redd.it/tmw18dpbk7bb1.jpg?width=1560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=42cec620de775ad5dc3eced4eb6d900aeaa24f8f)

# 6. ""LIES! They cheat!!! Ungrateful fifth column!... I'm nOt RaSiCt I hAvE aRab FrIeNds""

Ok Karen.

*Processing img u7q6zcfck7bb1...*

&#x200B;

# 7. Final Thoughts:

The affirmative actions in Israel does not discriminate Jewish students because it doesn't change acceptance bar for either group. It provides the Arab sector a framework similar to the one secular Jews already have. It doesn't discriminate against them as they both have to now compete on equal terms.

The only good reason why one would feel it's harder now to get accepted into a university than it was 15 years ago, is because their Arab peers have risen to the **same equal starting point** as them. *Before it was easy, now it* *~~hard~~* *fair.*

The dazzling success of Arabs in higher education isn't something to be feared, but something to be proud of! This is a group that has been neglected in almost every other facet, but with some support, they can break everybody's expectations (This is why we all those myths).

[Bring it](https://preview.redd.it/3vc3agvym7bb1.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ced27dec962e8bdcf7970a0f3dd764667b6bf8f1)

I had a passing in the family recently and so, spent some time at synagogue and sitting shiva with my family.

Although I wasn’t particularly close to the passed family member, this funeral left me feeling pretty bad. Having been in a synagogue for the the first time in 15 years reminded me of some of the things I love about Judaism, but also left me feeling resentful. My dads family are all Reform Jews, and growing up I was originally on the same path, but my mom came from a Christian family and never officially converted (although she also loved the Jewish faith), and so my Jewish family wouldn’t constantly tell me I wasn’t really Jewish because my mom wasn’t and they shunned her pretty harshly. Somewhat as a result, I stopped going to Hebrew school, never had a bat mitzvah, and eventually dropped all things religion. My Jewish family members are all still very active in their faith, and I feel like I missed out on what could have been a great community and enriching if I hadn’t felt like the black sheep.

Where I’m at now, I don’t know that I necessarily feel any kind of religious calling. I’m not sure I’m interested in “becoming Jewish,” because now I generally have negative feelings about organized religion, but I also want to be around it again. I just kind of miss it. But I wonder, since my goal is not necessarily to become a more religious person, would it be wrong for me to go to a synagogue? I don’t even know what I would do or when I would go, but I’ve wondered if it’s like church where you can just drop in? Is any of this disrespectful?"

So, I’m sorry if this is long winded but I had a few questions.

To start- my family is Jewish (mom’s side, an all female line leading to me with both Sephardic and Ashkenazi ancestors). No one in my family has practiced Judaism in at least 3 generations. My mom has told me about going to Bat and Bar Mitzvahs for my grandma’s extended family, but although my grandma was raised in a Jewish household they eventually drifted away.

I feel so drawn to Judaism and I want to explore it more. I’m in the baby steps of learning about the faith, but I keep finding myself drawn to prayers.

Here’s my question/questions:

Is there a source that has the daily prayers in English (I don’t speak or read Hebrew)? Can someone say the daily prayers in English? And the most important- is it okay or appropriate for me to say them given that I haven’t yet converted?

Like I said, I feel drawn to praying but I want to make sure that I’m doing things properly.

Another explanation I’ve heard is “it’s a sign that she is married” which also isn’t satisfactory because plenty of other thing can be used as a symbol of marriage. 

The best explanation I’ve heard is a kabbalistic one, in which there is a prohibition against men to growing long hair from their head due to the negative spiritual energy it gives off (according to the Arizal, not D’Oraisa). Upon marriage the husband’s and wife’s soul merge and so now that same negative spiritual energy can be given off by the women’s hair. Because it would be disrespectful to shave a woman’s hair, we cover it. This is the best explanation of the 3, but there are some Chasidim and Habbani Jews who DO grow their hair long, so that doesn’t exactly answer my question. So what is the halachic reason married women cover their hair and what is the symbolic significance? Any thoughts would be appreciated, thank you!"

Unfortunately, by the time I get to synagogue and find out they are short of a minyan, there wouldn't be enough time for any of my friends to get there.

My suggestion for those who want to help a friend in mourning is to just join them for a minyan to say Kaddish whenever you are available, not just when they absolutely need you to be the tenth person.  The companionship of friends joining to help say Kaddish is just as valuable whether they are needed for a minyan or not."

He told my sister that he doesn't feel a connection to Judaism.  My sister told him that he needs to have a talk with both me and his grandmother about his feelings if that's how he really feels.  

Some of this comes as a result of the fact that he was adopted, and is struggling with the emotions that surround it.  It is also difficult because our family is well educated, and he struggles with school and isn't driven at all to academics.  

The activities he involves himself are very different than those of most Jews.  He is a bit of a contrarian by nature, and thinks (as many teenagers do) that everyone else is stupid.  He only has a few close friends, none of them Jews, even though our family is very involved in the Jewish community in many ways.

My mother gave him my father's mezuzzah after he died.  As far as I know, he wears it regularly, if not daily.  But with this new knowledge of his 'exploring' another faith, including studying the ""Bible"" on his phone and watching evangelical tik toks, I'm not comfortable with him wearing a mezuzah, especially given the commandments which are written on it.  

What would you do?  My sister is supportive of anything he shows initiative of and is trying to be 'supportive' of his spiritual exploration, wherever it goes.  I don't know that I can be so supportive.  He is doing several things that his grandfather, of blessed memory, would not be pleased with."

Biden’s administration is quick to put the blame on the recent violence on increased settlements in the WB and the friction between Netanyahu and Biden is no secret with the former supporting President Trump over the latter.

With Bidens criticism of the Israeli leadership came Ben Gvir’s retort that Israel can build anywhere it wants in the WB.

These developments add to the uncertainty in the region. What will this bill be utilized to do exactly? How will the United States Administration respond to an unleashed Israel? Will Iran capitalize on the instability in Israel and Palestine to tighten its grip around Palestinians? Is Iran even an actual threat?

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

There are many definitions of ""life"". One uncommon definition could be any non-uniform collection of matter or energy that adapts, or has adapted, to fit its environment over time. Regardless of whether it is used as a definition or not, adaptability is a key feature of all life. In recent years, we have even learned to create software components that learn and adapt to achieve a goal in their ""virtual"" environment, which enhances our understanding of adaptive processes.

A notable limitation of systems or organisms that have learned to adapt to a specific environment is that it is often difficult for them to apply the same adaptation strategies to new environments. Change is hard.

Even as the most capable adaptive organism known to us, human beings face the same fundamental limitation as any other adaptive system. Throughout our lives, we acquire knowledge of how things work, and our attitudes and decisions reflect the strategies we have been taught or have developed for ourselves. We also struggle to adapt when the ""way things work"" changes.

When our physical, social, and technological environment undergoes significant change, we often resist accepting it in its new form. We stubbornly cling to the frameworks that our culture and belief systems created to cope with the world as it once was. We defend strategies and draw boundaries that we have believed in throughout our lives and the lives of our ancestors. Even when we do adapt and change, we often do so reluctantly and late.

However, abandoning too many of our values and beliefs can be just as dangerous, if not more so. There is no perfect solution or balance. Perhaps the best advice is that we must strive to look further, broaden our perspective, consider the larger picture, and ask ourselves not just what today's goal is, but where we ultimately want to be."

 Are there many Jewish laws that conflict with US laws? Either things that are permitted by Judaism but not by US law, or the other way around? Not just about same-sex marriage but about anything. One obvious one I can think of would be kashrut.

I know this is heavily affected by many factors so I'm looking for discussion more than absolute correct answers, of course. For example, denomination of Judaism or personal interpretations obviously affect this a lot.

Around this time Salem was mainly populated with Puritans, they had a strict and regimented lifestyle even the slightest that stand out are deemed as suspicious, there was a case about the Parris girls who started to behave strangely, speaking incoherent tongue, twisting their bodies in strange formations, the townspeople ruled out that both girls are the victims of witchcraft.

They pointed fingers at Tituba, who was a native american slave employed by the Parris family, she was known to play fortune-telling games which were heavily frowned upon by the Puritans, along with two other ladies: Sarah Good & Sarah Osbourne were hated by the community.

All 3 women were locked up awaiting trial, during the trial, Tituba confessed that she saw the devil with her own eyes, also stating there was a coven or a group of witches within the area. Osbourne and Good insisted they were innocent and had nothing to do with witchcraft however, the court remained skeptical, all of them including Tituba were found guilty and sentenced to be hanged.

Women and girls are not the only victims of accusations of witchcraft, men and children were subjected to the accusations as well, when the trials ended in 1693, 24 died as a result either during their time in jail or being hung.

Around 1692-93 in Israel, what was life like for both average and elite Israeli citizens back then? What was the political climate like at the time? Who ruled the country back then? What were relations with the rest of Europe or the West like during this era?"

I browsed around looking for a subreddit where I could ask this question, let me know if I might get more traction elsewhere.

I took a Jewish Culture History course in college and I remember a snippet of text that, in retrospect, was kind of foundational to my queer identity.

My memory is only semi-reliable, but what I remember goes like this. In the Babylonian exile, a Jewish poet responded to other Jews who claimed being gay was a sin. He responded by writing

>If God didn't want me to be gay, why is my boyfriend so cute when he's drunk?

This was my first exposure to classical notions of beauty - namely, beauty justifies attraction wherever there is both beauty and an eye to behold it - and I repeat that quote very often to my boyfriend (who is, indeed,  the *cutest* when he's three sheets to the wind).

Does anyone know where this quote comes from, or who else I could ask for help tracking it down?"

American(31) I had the opportunity to travel to Israel six weeks ago and met some interesting  men. Despite being single for over six years, I am not an avid dater due to my disillusionment with the American dating culture. I highly value my independence and personal space. However, I have noticed that the Israeli men I encountered during my visit seem to lack an understanding of boundaries. I found that they were more forward and persistent in their pursuit of me than what I was accustomed to. Although some may find this trait appealing, it made me feel uncomfortable and uneasy. For instance , calling me 3X/day, texts every day and won’t take NO For an answer. 

I’ve met from all walks of life and background …but Israelites men are just different species.

I'm in the Support Goy Infantry, and my wife's Rabbi hinted at wanting to start a bicycle club. Personally, I think that would be fun, and lends itself to humor. I've already envisioned a flier for it (""do you have what it takes to join a Jewish biker gang?""), and am perfectly fine with putting in the footwork to get things rolling until proper leadership can be elected. But part of the prep work for this sort of thing is having a framework for rules and constitution. For a bit of fun, I'd like to make it explicitly Jewish. And, just like any other group, it'll be voted in and then completely changed. For the basic rules, I'm picking and choosing from the commandments. For example, ""Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Meetings and events shall be scheduled between Sunrise Sunday, and Sunset Friday."" But basic rules of conduct are easy. HaShem did most of the work for me there.

What I'd like help with is coming up with some ""distinguishment awards"" . Ideally, they should be loosely based on the Mitzvot. If I could get some suggestions on justifying some things, that would be great. Like, how could it be considered a mitzvah to help someone with a flat tire? Or helping someone that's struggling to keep up? Or giving someone gear that you don't need? Or...? Maybe something for returning at the back of the pack? 

Again, doesn't need to be a perfect answer, and it can be totally absurd provided it's humor is good natured. I expect everything to be voted out and replaced, so silliness is fine. I'd just like to sell the idea that this will be a Jewish club for Jewish People. And more specifically that even though I'm getting it rolling, it doesn't belong to me."

You see protesters going ""where were you in Huwwara?"" when the security forces reacted to demonstrations. Recently in Tel Aviv I saw a poster on a bus stop blaming the government for letting settler ""pogromists"" run wild. Just today, as part of the huge demonstrations sweeping the country, some protesters established a tent ""outpost"" called Democracy Heights on a highway interchange and demanded connection to water and electricity in an obvious parody of settler tactics.

It seems to me that as the center-left has come to realize its huge institutional power, the disgust with the settler movement has come out in full force, especially in the wake of increased settler violence. The polls show that the right will lose catastrophically in the next election. I wonder if on the back of this next Israeli government might take decisive action to separate us, maybe not a 2SS but something like the INSS plan that would involve dismantling the settlements deep in the West Bank.

I of course don't know what will ultimately happen but it seems to me that the center-left is now hardening against the settlement movement. And it may well soon be in power."

Or allowing judges to selected themselves in perpetuity?  Can you imagine if US Supreme Court judges were the successive appointees of 1800s-era judges, and their ideological heirs?

I'm a rabbi who records a weekly podcast about the Torah portion from a Reform/progressive Jewish perspective. It's called Seven Minute Torah - because we explore the parsha in about 7-12 minutes.

Here's a description of this week's episode:

>***On the Other Side of the Water (Mattot-Masei):*** *As the Israelites are about to cross over into the Promised Land, the  tribes of Reuven and Gad step forward and say that they've decided to  stay where they are. What happens next teaches us a lot about what it is  to be a Jew in diaspora but still care about - and have a stake in -  the land of Israel.*

If you're interested, you can search for ""Seven Minute Torah"" in any podcast app (Apple, Spotify, etc). 7MT is in the top 100 Jewish podcasts in North America. Come join hundreds of fellow learners each week for a ""taste"" of Torah - through a modern lens.

1,2023-07-12,The Three State Solution,u/IWillNotArgueOnRedit,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/14x5n3m/the_three_state_solution/,"In my view, at some point, a catalyst will ignite a major conflict in the region unless a resolution to the land disputes are resolved. We have seen that the Israeli seculars, Jewish religious, and Palestinians exhibit fundamentally different value systems and find it difficult to live in a state which claims to represent the interest of all groups when it clearly does not. Separation of these groups is necessary.

Below I have outlined what I believe to be a reasonable partitioning of the land amongst the demographics to avoid future escalations and will result in autonomy and internationally recognized borders for all nations. 

The State of Israel: Undoubedtly, the most economically and politically leveraged demographic representing  secular Israelis from all creeds, ethnic backgrounds, and religions, will take the lion’s share of the land, likely most of the 1967 borders excluding Jerusalem and the Judean Hills. Israel would likely remain an economic powerhouse in the region and will continue to enjoy a high quality of life and positive relations with the US, EU, and maybe the Arab world. Freedom of religion and democracy would reign and traditional Jewish values would guide the future of the country. Capital: Tel Aviv

The State of Judea: Perhaps the most well connected amongst the diaspora religious Jews, the Jewish religious demographic representing religious Jewish interests and halacha law would likely negotiate for Area C of the West Bank. They would take full advantage of their connections with the diaspora and the settler movement and attempt to create a contiguous state within the negotiated territory. They will be faced with a new reality; an uneducated workforce, a sorely lacking military, and no economy aside from tourism and traditional forms of employment allowed by religious law. The State of Judea would likely enjoy good relations with religious Jews and evangelical Christians around the world but would continue to draw ire from the Arab and Christian world and would be responsible for much of the religious tension in the Holy Land due to it’s status quo stewardship of the holy sites of Area C. Capital: Jerusalem

The State of Palestine: With full support from the Arab world in it’s long battle for statehood, the State of Palestine would likely encompass Gaza and Areas A and B of the West Bank and it would work to ensure a contiguous territorry with freedom of movement in Gaza to Egypt and from the West Bank to Jordan and a possible connection between the territories. The elected officials would represent all factions of Palestinian society, both religious and secular. The State of Palestine, with international recognition, would enjoy autonomy and international financial support to jump start its economy and would likely be able to compete in traditional and possibly even developed economic sectors. Capital: Ramallah or Gaza City

Each new State would need to forge new relations with each other State once the borders will be determined. Given this scenario, Israel would likely be the most leveraged, and, without the burden of the conflict, will outperform expectations and continue to improve life for its citizens. Palestine would finally have the opportunity to prove itself on the international stage, and I would predict many good things to come from this. Judea would be able to survive of of foreign money and strong bonds with Israel but would seriously need to evaluate its economic leverage dramatically reshape it’s forein policy if it wishes to survive.

Thus, evil came into our universe from the disorder caused by this disintegration.

I was never very religious. I was raised in a Conservative synagogue. But, we were of the 3 times a year temple-goers. My mother was agnostic.

I am now as strongly atheist as one can be and would have no trouble writing out the name of hashem in any form. I just don't want to offend others here.

Given my own ignorance, I'm curious about Jewish beliefs at any and all levels of religiosity. Do Jews generally believe that hashem is perfect?

I ask because, relating to the flood, Genesis 6:6 indicates that hashem regretted creating humans. To me, this sounds as if hashem is asserting that his own earlier decision and action in creating humans was flawed and regrettable. This seems to me to strongly indicate that hashem is less than perfect and can make bad or flawed decisions.

What is the belief within Judaism regarding this?

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

Why are people sometimes willing to give their very lives for a cause?

The question of how it is possible that such a phenomenon exists should not be that difficult to answer. The assumption that an individual’s core programming consists of our drive to survive does not always hold. It may be more accurate to say that our programming mainly consists of achieving the mission we are convinced is most important, and if self-sacrifice is the best way of furthering that mission, then we will do that too.

A different question is what makes a culture or ideology advocate willingness to die or even commit suicide. What does this say about the values of such a system and is it correct to condemn such a system for advocating death over life?

It seems plausible to argue that the potential to condemn another belief system because it condones suicidal attackers is based on the terror we experience when faced with the possibility of such attacks. Throughout history, our basic protection from each other has relied on a system of deterrents based on the consequences of aggressive action. A person in the process of giving up their life to attack us, however, leaves us defenseless. This may explain why we would strongly condemn the values of the society that sends the attacker.

One basis for the moral condemnation of the society that encourages such attacks is the fact that the tactic today tends to target civilians. However, another basis for condemnation is the fact that there must be something deeply unethical about a belief system that prioritizes some vision of truth over life itself. It is this second line of condemnation that is being considered here.

Is this line of moral condemnation consistent? After all, many of the belief systems that we ourselves value, or consider enlightened and advanced, are also willing to pay homage to those who gave up their lives in order to defend their ideology. They are seen as martyrs for a worthy cause.

Does prioritizing an ideology over the value of life necessarily imply that the value of life itself is being undermined? In order to answer this question, one must ask what it is about life that we value. If there are situations where life itself is absolutely unbearable, then surely one cannot condemn a belief system that prioritizes preventing that, even at the cost of life itself.

However, if the basis for prioritizing a value over life itself is based on such extreme cases, it should not be extended beyond those extremes. Listing a few core principles that might make life unbearable is understandable, but extending this to temporary compromises on any of a long list of demands is unjustifiable.

Another moral consideration is whether the cause is based on preservation or driven by the belief that everyone else must adhere to the same ideology. If an ideology advocates martyrdom in preference to being forced into a life its own members would consider unbearable, that seems reasonable. If, on the other hand, martyrdom is advocated as a means of imposing their narrow view of the truth on everyone else, then the ideology should be condemned.

The last argument focuses on who is supposed to become the martyr. Individuals can be manipulated and brainwashed. Moreover, it is often the weakest, poorest, and least educated members of society who are most susceptible to being used as human weapons; they can even be threatened or blackmailed using physical or reputation threats to their family.

It seems difficult to condemn the very idea of sacrifice for a cause. However, the devil, as always, is in the details."

What would happen if jews decided to convert to Islam ☪️ and became Secular Muslims like a lot in Turkey 🇹🇷 happen to be?  Maybe some israelies could become secular Christians and live in Lebanon.  The difference in worship of God is getting them both persecuted but its the same God at the end of the day (sundown in both religions) that they worship.

If the Jews converted to islam or christianity then Hamas could make Palestine safe for all religions, its possible jews could maybe co exist but they are similar to Muslims.

I seen a pew survey that in America and even possibly Russia some  decide to identify as protestant Christians and catholic instead of Jewish.

They are similar religions, some jews still live in Turkey peacefully although they find it hard to marry in a muslim country.  

Maybe the simple solution is to become part of a more mainstream abrahamic belief like Islam or christianity.  

Christians in Lebanon are very secular snd live beside Muslim.  Maybe jews could become secular Christians.

Claiming Ashkenazi is an Israeli culture because all Jews come from Israel is exactly like claiming Han Chinese are an African culture because all humans come from Africa. It ignores the actual significance of said culture. Every subgroup of Judaism is unique in so many ways exactly BECAUSE they developed and are native to very different places.

This does not mean anything about a country’s right to exist. The way I see it no country has such right - they simply exist.

If you think being native grants you anything, you must be very racist towards Africans living in France right? Or poles living in Britain? Nativity is a stupid concept and the fact so many people here care tells one a lot about your racist character.

With that said, the relation between Israel and the Palestinians generally resembles the relation of a colony and the natives, and that is not my though, that is what Jabotinsky said."

This is my first reddit post so kindly be lenient on me, I'm just a random 14 year old living in Asia with no arab or jewish roots but very interested in the Holocaust and IP war. From my observations, I have drawn a rough conclusion of the plan Israel is going forward on to buy time. I deduce that Israel is evicting many Palestinians out of their homes through biased courts and is evoking international attention, and committing several other crimes against Palestinians such as prohibiting them from driving on better roads and others, which should all be classified under apartheid. A reason Israel gives is because Palestinians do not hold Israeli citizenship, thus they should rightfully be held under suspicion as hostile, potential threats due to past terrorism. Honestly, this explanation is plausible to me. Israel claims to incessantly offer Palestinians Citizenship, which they refuse. Yet if they do accept citizenship in exchange for equal treatment, they would be relinquishing most of the Palestinian identity that binds them together against Israel since they will be assimilated into Israel. Is this morally acceptable? Personally I am just stunned how well this strategy works, being acceptable to me and legal but still ultimately achieving Israel's goal.

Wanted to see if anyone here might be able to assist or point me in the right direction with regard to planning an orthodox wedding. I recently lost both of my parents, and my fiance is not from a jewish family thus her family can't provide much insight either.

I'm trying to find locations/options in the greater NYC/Long Island/NJ area that provide an all-inclusive option where we don't need to source each element on our own. I already blew $1,500 on a deposit to a non traditional hall where the caterer then quoted me $38k.....pre booze!

Would also love to get feedback from anyone who recently had one in terms of. expectations, costs, etc.

Thanks in advance."

I'd like to visit the Dead Sea in the morning, have lunch there and photograph the landscapes, then go to Jerusalem for the afternoon.

In the past at cruise ports, I've managed to either rent a car nearby, or hire a driver for the day. Are either of these possible in Ashdod? My searches haven't turned up much, except an outrageously expensive driver for 3040 ILS. 

Is Uber or Yandex possible between each location? Doesn't Ashdod city have car rental agencies? I realize it's a bit last minute.. I assumed there would be availability for such a typical tourism itinerary, without going through the typical channels of tour guides etc. Thanks for any info!"

1,2023-07-12,Questions from a Christian,u/MrChickenChef,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14xs6kx/questions_from_a_christian/,"I hope this is well received, I am just trying to do my best in understand your beliefs as best I can, and I want to be as unbiased as possible. I've posted this in christian subs as well, and I want to hear from this sub too. 

Some of the questions may be worded a bit bluntly, I would probably phrase it in a more diplomatic way if speaking in person but I just want to be direct in what I'm asking, not trying to offend or start an argument. I know these topics are very complex and have been argued for thousands of years. I just want some resources that I can look into to begin to understand what you believe on the questions I've asked

Here it is:

I'm trying to find some resources where I can find the arguments that Judaism uses to refute christianity. In my quick searches so far it seems like most Jewish arguments say its all because christians use the wrong OT translation, or they just misinterpret the OT. They also seem to say that the OT read and understood in a jewish lense reveals a much different image of the ""OT G-d"" than what christians typically have. I'm not saying there is a difference in OT/NT G-d but I am just curious how they are reading it differently.

I can't find a boiled down list of arguments (for Judaism). I just want to make sure I understand their point of view rather than start from my own bias. I'm assuming somebody here has been down the same road and has some videos, books, podcast, or article recommendations.

Here are some other some of my key questions:

Is it correct to assume that most of the arguments for ""christians misinterpreting the OT"" is just because one side is using the Greek OT and the other side uses the Hebrew OT? 

Is modern day Rabbinic judaism really a good representation of second temple judaism or is it something new/refined? Obviously practice is a bit different since there is no temple now

Most of early christianity was made up of jews (correct me if I'm wrong) why was it so convincing to so many then, but modern jews are unconvinced?

What does judasim say about the destruction of the temple in 70ad? It seems to me like the destruction of the temple/jerusalem 40 years after the resurrection is a strong sign from G-d.

I'm on neither side of the issue - but decided that I should probably choose a side. I don't live in the central area, so I've not been affected by the road closures. I've come across these facts:

1. People are protesting and disrupting critical infrastructure (roads).
2. These people say that they are fighting for democracy.
3. Many people who are not taking part of the protests do believe that these protesters are fighting for democracy, as they say.
4. As per the current laws, the members of the Knesset are elected.
5.  As per the current laws, these elected government members can create laws and these laws can be overturned by a body of non-elected people (the Supreme court).
6. The current elected government is taking actions to remove the ability of the non-elected body (the Supreme court) to override the laws created by the elected body (the Knesset).
7. The current elected government is using legal means to remove the ability of the Supreme court to override its laws.

So it looks *to me* that the current government is making Israel *more* democratic by removing the ability of a non-elected body to hinder the elected body. So those who value democracy should *be in favour of* the reform. **Where am I wrong?**

Furthermore, these protesters are actively harming other citizens (blocking critical infrastructure - and violently attacking people who try to drive through their blockades from what I've seen) to counter the actions of the elected government. So that is _another_ anti-democratic thing that these protesters are doing. **So why do people believe that these protesters want democracy, when their actions are on two points against democracy? Just because these people say ""democracy""?**

Surely these facts as I seem them are clear to everyone who sees them, so *where am I mistaken""? Honest question from someone who is trying to decide which side to support but has a hard time understanding one of the sides."

Victory Through Settlement
Creating a facts-on-the-ground Jewish presence in the West Bank through increased settlement, both in numbers and in spread across the area. The Jewish presence in the West Bank will become undeniable and irreversible. Arabs will eventually resign themselves to the fact that their terrorism is not a deterrent to Jewish life, opening the door to reconciliation between Jews and Arabs. Eventually, this will culminate in the application of sovereignty on the entirety of the West Bank and the termination of the military occupation.

Three Options
Peace and Local Identity
All Palestinians who wish to stay will be given automatic Blue Cards (permanent residency) and all the rights therein, including total freedom of movement. The cities of Hebron, Bethlehem, Ramallah, Jericho, Shechem, and Jenin will be given an enhanced autonomous status, allowing Palestinians to best influence the systems they live under while recognizing the uniqueness of their local identities and systems. Palestinians who want citizenship will receive it through IDF service, much like how the Druze serve in the IDF.

Emigration
All Palestinians who do not wish to remain in Israel from this point on will be given financial compensation for emigration to a country of their choice.

Military Victory
All Palestinians and Palestinian groups who continue to conduct terrorism and warfare against Israel and Israelis will be thoroughly crushed, with the renewed self-assuredness that they were no longer rejecting the fake peace of a two-state solution, but a just solution that affords them their rights and aspirations."

As some of you migth know there is a saying about ""The jewish bookcase"". Basiclly, it talks about the fact that there is a HUGE amount of jewish stories and writing that talk about the jewish experince and that are essential in understanding judaism itself to some degree. But I have a question:

What IS in the bookcase.

Assume we can only have one bookcase filled with jewish books. What books make the list? For example obvisely the tanakh and mishna enter. But what about agadah litrature? What about the whole Q & A subgenre. Obviselly we cant count a website called ""ask the rabbi"" as a book.

And that's just the books with inherentely religious concepts!

What about ""The wars of the jews"" by joshiphus? What about holocust litrature?
What about itzchak bashevis zinger?
Isaac Asimov? 
Franz Kafka?

So the question I have. Is what do YOU think? Assuming you have a bookcase you need to fill with ""the jewish books and stories"". What books would YOU put in it? Why this book and not another? And lastly. Do you think ANYONE can agree about this book, because let's be honset. We don't agree about nothing. 

P. S. Asumming there was a limit for the amount of books in the bookcase. How would you choose what to put in and what to put out?

Is this it? Yeah. I think I'm done..."

My parents are atheist and christian, so I grew up mostly around christians, and celebrated christian holidays. I was always made aware that my grandfather was Jewish, and he loved sharing that with me, mostly through cooking and stories. He wanted me to have bat mitzvah but because I was not raised Jewish, it would have been completely out of left field. I attended a Catholic school for one year when I was very young because of odd zoning laws in the small town I lived in, and was made to sit at the back of the church during mass with the only other Jewish boy. I still don't even know how the sisters knew! Later in life when I attended public school I would tell the other Jewish kids that I was Jewish, and they would say I wasn't on account of the matrilineal rule, I didn't go to Hebrew school with them, and I didn't have a bat mitzvah. So I wasn't jewish enough to be accepted by the Jewish community, but I *was*Jewish enough to be persecuted by the Catholics. I'm also apparently Jewish enough to have Crohn's disease, a genetic hand-me-down I would rather not have (half-joking of course).

As I got older, I felt a strong pull towards that tiny portion of my family. I went through our family history, I read about the culture, and the religion. I started celebrating the holidays on my own. I taught myself the blessings, learning proper pronunciation through YouTube videos. I do feel like it is a part of who I am, yet some days (let's be honest, most days) I feel like an imposter. I have read a lot of threads in this subreddit and I do worry about cultural appropriation, if I'm cherry-picking only the parts of Judaism I agree with, and whether or not I can even call myself Jewish. My grandfather is growing very old now and it's clear that his time is growing short. I don't want this part of my family history to die with him, as just a footnote to my future kids that my grandpa was Jewish, because it feels like so much more than that to me."

1,2023-07-13,Pressure to be Israeli,u/magicianguy131,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14y6uwn/pressure_to_be_israeli/,"(I apologize if this is a controversial topic - I don't mean to be, just curious on other thoughts.)

I'm Canadian/American and all Jewish. I have roots who came over during the 1930s/40s and I have other Jewish roots who came over early on. My family is fully Ashkenazi. I even have some roots in Israel. 

But I have very little interest in Israel or becoming Israeli. I have been there. I did the birthright. I speak relatively good contemporary Hebrew. I have noticed that many of my very Jewish friends have that almost cultural obsession with Israel. Many have served and many are living there or traveling between there and this side of the world.

I always thought it was odd. I mean, I am Jewish. They're Jewish. But why can't I be very Jewish here? 

I am very interested in Yiddish and the early 20th-century Yiddish culture. There was once a robust and strong Yiddish Jewish cultural scene in both the US and Canada.  I am very interested in that expression of my Judaism, rather than that of Israel. A lot of my friends and family see this interest has pointless; they instead direct me east, to Israel.

I understand the draw of Israel, particularly with a rise in anti-semitism in the US. But I go to Israel but I get frustrated that I don't feel the same connection as others. And not just with certain politics. I don't feel that connection. I felt more connected to my heritage visiting old Jewish/Yiddish settlements in Germany than wondering about the urban streets of Tel Aviv or the ancient neighborhoods of Jerusalem. 

Maybe it's just the people in my circles who are skewing my view. But it seems like everyone has this narrow focus on getting that Israeli passport, or this view that Israel is the ultimate goal. My desire to be Jewish here - be it American, Canadian, or even Yiddish - seems to go against the zeitgeist.

And again, I understand why people see Israel - the hope, the history, the ideology. But I just don't have that draw to Israel.

Muslims have that with their countries, Jews have that with Israel, Hindus should have that with India, and Christians have that with American and Europe. But it seems that even that's not enough for anti-zionists who want to end the only Jewish state. Not only that but they are okay with the expulsion of innocent Jews from Arab countries who did nothing wrong.
  

  
If you believe that then you can't complain if Europe chooses to throw out its Muslims. After all it is their land and they have a right to do what they want with it. Lets also not forget that Palestine supporters routinely attack random Jews in their ""protests"". That's not going to stop if they get what they want they'll just start demanding that Europe become a sharia puppet state.

And before you complain about ""muh wars in middle east"" isn't a big talking point the Palestinians aren't responsible their government? Well guess what same applies here. I didn't want refugees I didn't want wars I just wanted to be left alone with my neighbors without getting my job taken away or my welfare stolen by illegal migrants or my religion disrespected.
  

  
Everyone deserves a homeland and above all Jews deserve the same rights Muslim do. I have no quarrel with Muslim nations but I do have a quarrel with greedy people taking more than their fair share. If you want Palestine then Europe and America should be left alone because you cannot live everywhere in the world while throwing out other people. If you don't want that leave Israel alone and start giving back your blood debt to the Jews you expelled from Arab countries.

1,2023-07-13,Why I think Israel's policies in regards to land reclamation are problematic.,u/Peltuose,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/14yb3ok/why_i_think_israels_policies_in_regards_to_land/,"This week marked the end of a decades-long legal battle over an apartment in the Old City of Jerusalem. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Israeli authorities accompanied by settlers stormed the family house, arrested five activists present in it and forcibly evicted the Sub Laban family residing there replacing them with illegal settlers who seized portions of the building and hoisted Israeli flags over it. This comes after the The Department of Execution and Procedure had said the family would be evicted between 28 June to 13 July. According to the Times of Israel the Jewish plaintiffs were saying that the Palestinian residents are 'squatters' in an apartment historically owned by Jews. It's worth mentioning that the residence *was* owned by a trust for Kollel Galicia, a group that collected funds in Eastern Europe for Jewish families in Jerusalem prior to the first Arab-Israeli war, and at it's surface this case might not seem wholly interesting or very unique, as this is pretty much the full picture about this specific situation that is being depicted in the media. Except there is a much more deeprooted and systemic issue related to this and many other cases like it in regards to how and to who Israel issues land re-acclamations.   


First off let's start with the term 'squatter'. It is quite a popular term to describe Palestinians living not only in East Jerusalem but in other places in the West Bank also. For people more familiar with the Israeli right you probably know of someone called Aryeh King who is currently serving as the Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem. He also happens to be a central figure in the Israel Land Fund, who's stated mission is 'putting the land of Israel back into Jewish hands' via advertising and facilitating property sales exclusively for Jewish residents. On the Israel Land Fund's website website (which has since been updated) you could find investing opportunities for ""ideology properties"" for lands/residences in East Jerusalem under Hebrew names. In one listing it said plots were being *squatted* on by Arabs who have built on them illegally or are renting in a neighborhood he's helping evict a Palestinian family from a house in. This man is also on record saying that this neighborhood [will be a Jewish neighborhood](https://youtu.be/kbPnF8Hvj0I?t=42) and given that Israel [bans Palestinians from construction anyway](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2020-01-21/ty-article/.premium/israel-rejects-98-of-palestinian-building-permit-requests-in-west-banks-area-c/0000017f-f7ce-d044-adff-f7ff0b250000) (I'm assuming this policy is also upheld in East Jerusalem and not just Area C) it is doubtful that actions like this are anything more than race-based land claims to random houses and neighborhoods anywhere in Jerusalem, regardless of whether or not the property actually ever was ever owned by Jews. Also, Aryeh King, who was one of the founders of the Ma'ale HaZeitim settler compound, told The New York Times that the eviction of Palestinian families was ""of course"" part of a municipal strategy to create ""layers of Jews"" throughout East Jerusalem.  


It's also worth mentioning that the property in Sheikh Jarrah in dispute, for example, includes plots of land that the Palestinian residents of Sheikh Jarrah (who were refugees) received in an UNRWA lottery, who relinquished in return their refugee documents and accompanying rights. 28 Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah had housing units built for them in agreement by UNRWA and the Jordanian government. Some people might assume that virtually any house in dispute in East Jerusalem that Palestinians lived/live in had actually been owned by Jews prior to the first Arab-Israeli war, however settlers and settler organizations also target houses built by and for Arabs on properties they claim belonged to Jews (although this claims have varying authenticities). They have no right under Israeli law to repossess their pre-1948 homes in Haifa, Sarafand and Jaffa. It seems unfair that Palestinians both have had to relinquish return to their original cities and localities as well as the residences which they were resettled in by the UN and lived in for decades, while that same standard is not applied to Jews. It seems as though this term is meant to be more of an insult than an accurate description. Aryeh King is certainly not the only example of someone making claims or using words like this. 

One thing is abundantly clear to me. There is in fact widespread systemic discrimination going on in regards to land reclamation. Jewish residents do have a legal process to re-claim land. Palestinians do not. In the video I linked above, the house Aryeh King is helping evict of it's Palestinian residents either did have Jewish residents prior to the first Arab-Israeli war or was owned by them so they were able to reclaim it via the courts since a descendant of the family eventually sold it off to Aryeh King who then passed it on to another settler who was a member of the Israel Land Fund, where both King and this settler jubilantly delivered an eviction notice to the Palestinians living there on video.  


There is some evidence to support the fact that there is some form of discrimination/double-standards going on here. Golda Meir, the same lady who made the famous ""There was no such thing as Palestinians"" statement, had actually lived in Villa Harun al Rashid, which was a house in the Jerusalem suburb of Talbiyya, built and originally owned by Palestinian Hanna Bisharat and taken over by the Israeli Foreign Ministry. The original owner’s grandson, George Bisharat, explains the situation surrounding their family home [here](https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Rite-of-return-to-a-Palestinian-home-2647312.php), [here](https://www.palestine-studies.org/en/node/77900), and [here](https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/5236).  Anticipating a visit from U.N. Secretary General Dag Hammerskjold, it is said, she ordered the sandblasting of the tiles on the front of the house to obliterate the ""Villa Harun ar-Rashid"" and thereby conceal the fact that she was living in an Arab home, however it seems as though the name is still faintly visible according to George.

Arabs living in neighborhoods within West Jerusalem such as Katamon and Malha were forced to leave and Jews in East Jerusalem, including the Old City of Jerusalem and Silwan, had the same fate. Almost 33% of the land in West Jerusalem in the pre-mandate period had been owned by Palestinians, and the Knesset passed laws to transfer these Arab-owned lands to Israeli Jewish organizations (more on that in a bit). In essence there was something like a 'population exchange' where Jewish and Arab refugees were often but not always re-settled in homes that formerly belonged to other refugees in Jerusalem.  The evacuated Jewish residents were resettled in Palestinian homes in West Jerusalem and the evacuated Palestinian residents were resettled in Jewish homes in East Jerusalem. Again this was not the case for all, but this did happen to an extent on both sides. By the time of the armistice that ended active fighting, Israel had control of 12 of Jerusalem's 15 Arab residential quarters. An estimated minimum of 30,000 people had become refugees.  


So here we have a situation where some refugees on both ends are being re-settled in homes that were formerly owned by random people of the 'other side'. This was pretty much the status-quo until 1967. After Israel conquered the West Bank Jews were able to both contest ownership claims in East Jerusalem and elsewhere as well as enforce rulings by the Israeli government. Palestinians could not.   


This leaves us with today's situation, where land reclamation can pretty much only be awarded to Jews and not Arabs meaning Palestinians like the Bisharat family cannot get their home back, because they were stripped of the title to their home through a law passed by the newly-established Israel called the Absentee Property Law:  


From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_land_and_property_laws) (apologies for the lengthy excerpt):

""**The absentees’ property laws were several laws which were first introduced as emergency ordinances issued by the Jewish leadership but which after the war were incorporated into the laws of Israel. As examples of the first type of laws are the** ***Emergency Regulations (Absentees’ Property) Law, 5709-1948 (December)*** **which according to article 37 of the** ***Absentees Property Law, 5710-1950*** **was replaced by the latter; the** ***Emergency Regulations (Requisition of Property) Law, 5709-1949*****, and other related laws.**

**According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 41), unlike other laws that were designed to establish Israel’s legal control over lands, this body of law focused on formulating a legal definition for the people (mostly Arabs) who had left or been forced to flee from these lands.

**As a result, two million** **dunams** **were confiscated and given to the custodian, who later transferred the land to the development authority. This law created the novel citizenship category of ""****present absentees****"" (nifkadim nohahim), persons present at the time but considered absent for the purpose of the law. These Israeli Arabs enjoyed all civil rights-including the right to vote in the** **Knesset** **elections-except one: the right to use and dispose of their property. About 30,000-35,000 Palestinians became ""present absentees"".**

**According to** **Simha Flapan****, ""a detailed account of exactly how abandoned Arab property assisted in the absorption of the new immigrants was prepared by** **Joseph Schechtman****"":**

>**It is difficult to overestimate the tremendous role this lot of abandoned Arab property has played in the settlement of hundreds of thousands of Jewish immigrants who have reached Israel since the proclamation of the state in May 1948. Forty-seven new rural settlements established on the sites of abandoned Arab villages had by October 1949 already absorbed 25,255 new immigrants. By the spring of 1950 over 1 million dunams had been leased by the custodian to Jewish settlements and individual farmers for the raising of grain crops.**  
**Large tracts of land belonging to Arab absentees have also been leased to Jewish settlers, old and new, for the raising of vegetables. In the south alone, 15,000 dunams of vineyards and fruit trees have been leased to cooperative settlements; a similar area has been rented by the Yemenites Association, the Farmers Association, and the Soldiers Settlement and Rehabilitation Board. This has saved the Jewish Agency and the government millions of dollars. While the average cost of establishing an immigrant family in a new settlement was from $7,500 to $9,000, the cost in abandoned Arab villages did not exceed $1,500 ($750 for building repairs and $750 for livestock and equipment).**  
**Abandoned Arab dwellings in towns have also not remained empty. By the end of July 1948, 170,000 people, notably new immigrants and ex-soldiers, in addition to about 40,000 former tenants, both Jewish and Arab, had been housed in premises under the custodian's control; and 7,000 shops, workshops and stores were sublet to new arrivals. The existence of these Arab houses-vacant and ready for occupation-has, to a large extent, solved the greatest immediate problem which faced the Israeli authorities in the absorption of immigrants. It also considerably relieved the financial burden of absorption.**

**How much of Israel's territory consists of land confiscated with the Absentee Property Law is uncertain and much disputed.** [**Robert Fisk**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fisk) **interviewed the Israeli Custodian of Absentee Property, who estimates this could amount to up to 70% of the territory of the state of Israel:**

>**The Custodian of Absentee Property does not choose to discuss politics. But when asked how much of the land of the state of Israel might potentially have two claimants — an Arab and a Jew holding respectively a British Mandate and an Israeli deed to the same property — Mr. Manor \[the Custodian in 1980\] believes that 'about 70 percent' might fall into that category.**  
**—** [**Robert Fisk**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fisk)**, 'The Land of Palestine, Part Eight: The Custodian of Absentee Property',** ***The Times*****, December 24, 1980, quoted in his book** ***Pity the Nation: Lebanon at War***

**The Jewish National Fund, from** ***Jewish Villages in Israel*****, 1949:**

>**Of the entire area of the State of Israel only about 300,000-400,000 dunums – apart from the desolate rocky area of the southern Negev, at present quite unfit for cultivation – are State Domain which the Israeli Government took over from the Mandatory regime. The J.N.F. and private Jewish owners possess under two million dunums. Almost all the rest belongs at law to Arab owners, many of whom have left the country. The fate of these Arabs will be settled when the terms of the peace treaties between Israel and her Arab neighbours are finally drawn up. The J.N.F., however, cannot wait until then to obtain the land it requires for its pressing needs. It is, therefore, acquiring part of the land abandoned by the Arab owners, through the Government of Israel, the sovereign authority in Israel. Whatever the ultimate fate of the Arabs concerned, it is manifest that their legal right to their land and property in Israel, or to the monetary value of them, will not be waived, nor do the Jews wish to ignore them. ... \[C\]onquest by force of arms cannot, in law or in ethics, abrogate the rights of the legal owner to his personal property. The J.N.F., therefore, will pay for the lands it takes over, at a fixed and fair price.**

**The absentee property played an enormous role in making Israel a viable state. In 1954, more than one third of Israel's Jewish population lived on absentee property and nearly a third of the new immigrants (250,000 people) settled in urban areas abandoned by Arabs. Of 370 new Jewish settlements established between 1948 and 1953, 350 were on absentee property (Peretz,** ***Israel and the Palestinian Arabs*****, 1958).**  


 **The Absentees’ Property Law, 5710- 1950**

**This law replaced the** ***Emergency Regulations (Absentees’ Property) Law, 5709-1948*****. According to** **Sabri Jiryis** **(p. 84), the definition of ""absentee"" in the law was framed in such a way as to ensure that it applied to every Palestinian or resident in Palestine who had left his usual place of residence in Palestine for any place inside or outside the country after the adoption of the partition of Palestine resolution by the UN. Article 1(b) states that ""absentee"" means:**

>**""absentee"" means -**  
**(1) a person who, at any time during the period between the 16th Kislev, 5708 (29th November, 1947) and the day on which a declaration is published, under section 9(d) of the Law and Administration Ordinance, 5708-1948(1), that the state of emergency declared by the Provisional Council of State on the 10th Iyar, 5708 (19th May, 1948)**  
**(2) has ceased to exist, was a legal owner of any property situated in the area of Israel or enjoyed or held it, whether by himself or through another, and who, at any time during the said period -**  
**(i) was a national or citizen of the Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Trans-Jordan, Iraq or the Yemen, or(ii) was in one of these countries or in any part of Palestine outside the area of Israel, or(iii) was a Palestinian citizen and left his ordinary place of residence in Palestine(a) for a place outside Palestine before the 27th Av, 5708 (1st September, 1948); or(b) for a place in Palestine held at the time by forces which sought to prevent the establishment of the State of Israel or which fought against it after its establishment;(2) a body of persons which, at any time during the period specified in paragraph (1), was a legal owner of any property situated in the area of Israel or enjoyed or held such property, whether by itself or through another, and all the members, partners, shareholders, directors or managers of which are absentees within the meaning of paragraph (1), or the management of the business of which is otherwise decisively controlled by such absentees, or all the capital of which is in the hands of such absentees;**

**According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 41), the provisions in the law made sure that the term 'person' did not apply to** **Jews****. The law also applied to Arabs who had become citizens of the State of Israel but were not in their usual place of residence as defined by the law. In this case, they were referred to as 'present absentees' and many lost their lands.**

**The Law then appointed a Custodianship Council for Absentees' Property, whose president was to be known as the Custodian of Absentees' Property (Article 2). The law then made these properties the legal holdings of the Custodian. According to Art. 4.(a)(2):**

>**every right an absentee had in any property shall pass automatically to the Custodian at the time of the vesting of the property; and the status of the Custodian shall be the same as was that of the owner of the property.**

**According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 41), those who were found to occupy property in violation of this law could be expelled, and those who built on such property could have their structures demolished. The law came to apply not only to Palestinians who fled but also to those who were away from their regular places of residence (as described in the previous paragraph).**

**According to the** ***Israel Government Yearbook, 5719 (1958)*** **(p. 235), the ""village properties"" of absentee Arabs ""which was appropriated by the Custodian of Absentees' Property"" included ""\[the land of\] some 350 completely abandoned or semi-abandoned \[Arab\] villages, the aggregate area of which was about three-quarters of a million dunums .... Among the agricultural properties were 80,000 dunums of abandoned groves... \[and\] more than 200,000 dunums of plantations were taken over by the custodian. ""It was estimated that ""the urban properties ... include\[d\] 25,416 buildings in which there are 57,497 dwellings and 10,727 business and trade premises.**

**According to COHRE and BADIL (p. 41), ""estimates of the total amount of ‘abandoned’ lands to which Israel laid claim vary between 4.2 and 5.8 million dunum (4 200-5 800 km²). Between 1948 and 1953 alone, 350 of the 370 new Jewish settlements were created on lands confiscated under the Absentees’ Property Law.**

**The Absentees’ Property Law underwent several amendments. Both amendments clarifying rental arrangements and tenant protection rights on such property.""**

So in effect, Israel's laws allow Jews to file claims over property held prior to 1948, but reject Palestinian claims over property that they owned prior to 1948 in Israel proper leading to a one-way street of selective justice. What further supports the idea that there is in fact selective justice and double standards going on in regards to land is the fact that [Israel recently legalized 9 illegal West Bank outposts, all of which were built without permits and some which were built on private Palestinian land](https://www.timesofisrael.com/cabinet-okays-legalization-of-9-west-bank-outposts-in-response-to-jerusalem-attacks/) and most if not all settlements in the West Bank have been built on land expropriated from Palestinian localities, and in some cases surrounding private Palestinian land which Palestinians can't access. It seems clear that there is a stark contrast between how Israel deals with Palestinians and Jews in regards to issues relating to land.   


While not all (or maybe any) Arab-Israelis might be affected by policies like this, but here I am discussing an issue that applies to many non-Israeli Palestinians who constitute the overwhelming majority of the population.

1,2023-07-13,Why can't the Palestinians accept Western norms?,u/JustinBieberFan1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/14ybwy5/why_cant_the_palestinians_accept_western_norms/,"As someone who used to support Palestine because of Israel's mistreatment of it, I'm wondering why the hell they find it so hard to accept Western norms? For example, Palestinians don't accept basic things such as the concept that accused persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty, as well as democracy, and human rights. Ironically, democracy and human rights are the same things that Palestinians claim to be fighting for in their war against Israel. However, I doubt that a Palestinian victory, or even a two state solution, will lead to anything but the abolition of democracy and human rights in a Palestinian state.

These things can't be hard, let alone impossible to accept. Many other countries accept those concepts, even Israel. Despite that fact, it often gets demonised not only by Palestinians, especially the BDS movement, but even by the UK government, including it's puppet media outlet, the supposedly ""independent"" BBC, the State of Palestine, the Egyptian government, its ""independent"" press and media outlets, as well as supposedly ""impartial"" pro-environment groups e.g. Extinction Rebellion, and many others, for doing things that any other western country would do under exactly the same circumstances i.e. acting in self defence against multiple rocket attacks on a constant basis from a known terrorist organisation, that is even recognised as such by many of the western countries that demonise Israel. 

If that is the case, then it makes me wonder why the Palestinians resort to such hypocrisy? If they're looking for an Arab country to live in and can't accept the western values of Israel, the USA, UK, or other western countries, why don't they demand that Jordan grant them citizenship? Not only do many Palestinians live in Jordan, but they are even a majority there. My belief is that they couldn't give a monkeys about democracy, equality, or other rights. Israelis are simply being gaslighted and blackmailed into giving up a western country so that they can have more land. Ironically, many ""Palestinian refugees"" have never set inside Israel proper. When I consider the claims of most of these ""refugees"", it is obvious that in the event of a two state solution they should be entitled to a right of return to the Palestinian state, not to Israel proper. This should still apply if their ancestor's homes are in Israel.

My belief, as someone who used to support the Palestinian cause out of ignorance, is that a two state solution is impossible. Even if you could figure out exactly where to put the Israeli Palestinian border, you would have the problem of defending it. Even if you could figure out that, you could only defend a small country like Israel from 22 Arab countries for so long. Even if you could miraculously do that, what stops Putin, Xi Jingping, the POTUS, or the British Prime Minister, jumping on to the dogpile in the event that Israel tries to do something that any other country simply doesn't accept. What if Israel's nuclear weapons program were discovered by a foreign power e.g. the USA? What if Israel hit back too hard against Palestinian aggression? What if they bombed a nuclear reactor in an Arab country? There are endless possibilities that things could go wrong. 

It's easier just to tell the Palestinians, that at least for now, the answer is no. Today more than ever, Israel needs the West Bank for its own defence. However, it doesn't need the Gaza Strip, nor does it need to terminate the Oslo Accords entirely by retaking Areas A and B by force, since that would provoke international outrage, and likely lead to an end to Israel's fragile peace treaty with Jordan. All those are a no no, even Netanyahu is showing no enthusiasm for going that far. Instead I propose my version of the Three State Solution, Israel (including an annexed Area C, to be called ""Judea and Samaria"") for the Israelis, as well as Jordan, and the Gaza Strip for the Palestinians. As for the problem of Areas A and B, which I propose remain called the ""West Bank"", the solution is to leave them be as areas that are purposefully left out of my solution entirely. If the Palestinians want a seperate solution for those areas, they will agree to one in due course. If not (more likely), then let them live with the resulting checkpoints and fences. 

In this scenario, good fences make good neighbours. No fences make high murder rates. That way, Israel can stay out of the West Bank, and not have to worry about the dangers of terrorism and hostile infiltration. The Palestinian Authority can concentrate on improving the lives of the Palestinian people, without having to worry about keeping terrorists from crossing into Israel. I know which one I would want if I were an Israeli. The problem is now solved for the foreseeable future, at least until the Palestinians can show that they're a harmless peace loving people who want Western norms and democracy, like they keep claiming to be. Then the Israelis might take a different view."

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/byl51r2skobb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8903bccf673083e855a5770f92c17b22185923b4

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

There are individuals on this planet who lack empathy. Most people, hopefully, feel a deep emotion of sympathy when they witness or hear about human suffering. However, there are others who do not experience any instinctive or emotional response to suffering, even if they are the ones causing it.

The absence of empathic responses does not mean that these individuals are only cold and calculating. While some may possess such traits, they may also be others who are driven by other emotional instincts such as self-interest, curiosity, vengeance, self-righteousness, delight, or the satisfaction of accomplishing a mission.

The ability or inability to feel empathy is not a binary distinction. Some people may feel little empathy, while others are profoundly affected by the pain of others. Additionally, it is not a one-dimensional spectrum. Some individuals may feel strong empathy for those close to them, but none for those they see as ""other."" Furthermore, individuals may differ in whether they only experience empathy in the direct presence of suffering or if they are equally affected by third-hand reports.

Perhaps the reason some people completely lack the instinct for empathy is due to a simple hereditary flaw, similar to a flawed trait of kidney function. On the other hand, empathic receptivity may be influenced by culture or childhood experiences. The precise role of these factors and the proportion of individuals who are hereditarily flawed in this regard versus those influenced by environmental factors remains unknown.

What we do know is that at various times and locations during the 20th century, for example, there were numerous instances in which people in positions of power or bystanders showed no emotional response to the suffering they caused.

It is plausible to imagine that there are individuals who are missing empathy physiologically yet are genuinely good people in every other aspect. These individuals may develop different physiological pathways during childhood or as a result of their culture, leading them to dedicate their lives to the well-being of others. Similarly, there may be highly empathic individuals with psychological challenges that prevent them from helping others.

Furthermore, it is important to note that not all injustices and suffering in the world are the result of a lack of empathy. There are various other causes, including self-interest, unfounded fears about personal future, reluctance to allocate resources to assist others, and misinformation about global events and the reasons behind them.

While this depiction may appear bleak, there is hope in the idea that low levels of empathy are not necessarily hereditarily determined. Recognizing these flaws in human personality allows us to work towards structuring society in a way that minimizes empathy deficiencies. We can also strive to protect individuals, despite the potential risks associated with a lack of care for their plight.

If we acknowledge our capacity for causing harm, we can implement appropriate educational and legal measures to prevent humanity from behaving the way it sometimes tends to behave."

I was just reading about it again and it seems there’s an updated version of the law with a new requirement: “from September 2022 onwards, it will be necessary to submit a certificate of ownership, transmitted by death, of rights over real estate located in Portugal. The ownership of personal rights of enjoyment or shareholdings in commercial companies or cooperatives with headquarters in Portugal is also accepted. To prove this, instead of a certificate, an affidavit with this content will suffice.”

So like I mentioned above I have managed to confirm that my ancestors were indeed affected by the events in the 15th century. Based on that how would I be able to look up what their land/property holdings might have been? Is there some kind of record of which families had what taken from them?

11,2023-07-13,BDS on the Scorecard,u/TracingBullets,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/14ymjaf/bds_on_the_scorecard/,"BDS supporters like to say their hate campaign against Israel is the same as the divestment and academic boycotts of South Africa. Usually when responding to this, opponents of BDS try and claim the situations are different or the goals of the campaigns are different, which are both true. But this time I would like to look at the scorecard.

Most BDS supporters may not be aware of this but divestment from South Africa started on a large scale in 1984, and only *six years later* it ended because apartheid was gone:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinvestment_from_South_Africa

Within one year, more than 50 institutions had divested and within two years federal legislation was enacted in the United States.

Now let's look at BDS. It's been 20 years since it was officially founded, leaving aside the Arab boycott and BDS under a different name before it which began decades earlier. Although it isn't a complete failure, [the vast majority of BDS ""successes""](https://uscpr.org/activist-resource/boycott-divestment-and-sanctions/bdswins/) are things like statements of support from food coops and small far left colleges. 

Pro-Israel people often point out Israel's rising GDP over the last 20 years, but it's more than that. BDS itself is now getting condemned and even outlawed by European countries like [France](https://www.france24.com/en/20160120-france-boycott-israel-bds-law-free-speech-antisemitism), [Spain](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-landmark-ruling-top-spanish-court-says-bds-movement-infringes-on-basic-rights/), and [Germany](https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-bds-israel/germany-designates-bds-israel-boycott-movement-as-anti-semitic) and even being considered a hate movement. Can you imagine the anti-apartheid movement being condemned like that by liberal Western countries? And no, Palestine supporters, this doesn't mean the nefarious Israel Lobby has its hooks there as well. It means you've failed to make the argument.

Don't forget [the anti-BDS laws and policies in the United States](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/anti-bds-legislation) and [now in the UK](https://www.jpost.com/bds-threat/article-746743). Usually every conversation about these laws revolves around whether not they are constitutional or whether they violate free speech. This time, I would like to take another perspective: constitutional or not, these laws show that BDS, again, has lost the argument. And if you can't win the argument, you certainly won't be able to get a movement going even if you have a victory here and there. The arguments on the social media are all beside the point: in the places where people who make the decisions are listening, BDS is losing and in fact always has been. To have your cause enshrined in legislation and stay in legislation, you need to win widespread popular support for it first. People don't appreciate being baited and switched about this kind of thing, and that's all BDS is able to do. 

So if we're going to compare BDS to the anti-apartheid divestment campaign, it sure looks like BDS is going in the opposite direction. Israel supporters aren't the ones being condemned in European parliaments, BDS is. Israelis aren't the ones being opposed through legislation, BDSers are. That is the difference. Just look at the scorecard."

1,2023-07-13,Considering breaking Kosher,u/Educational_Piano_35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14yoi1g/considering_breaking_kosher/,"This is something that’s really been eating at me that I don’t think my non-jew friends would understand. 

I live in a city with a fairly small Jewish population. My mom’s side ranges from conservative to orthodox and my dad’s family is Catholic. Growing up, my brother and I weren’t given any pressure to side one way or another and were essentially raised agnostic. Still, we celebrated all of the major Jewish holidays (as well as the Hallmark Christian ones), kept certain traditions, and participated in groups for Jewish kids. As proud as I was of my identity, I always felt out of place, both with the few orthodox kids and the rest of the city. It felt weird being a token everywhere I went when I barely followed the basics.

Today, I’m a proud atheist who embraces my Jewish ethnicity. Yet, there are certain traditions that I have a hard time letting go of. For instance, my mom (who has gotten more and more religious over time) still expects us to participate in the Passover Seder each year. I feel strongly against reading certain passages and grow more and more uncomfortable each year, but feel compelled to keep the tradition alive. 

It’s the exact same way with food. While we never kept “full” kosher (no dairy/meat separation—we could never afford two separate kitchens), we’ve always avoided pork, seafood, catfish, etc. I know many of you can understand how difficult maintaining this outside of the house can be. I missed so many pizza parties, went hungry for poorly planned work lunches, interrogated every waiter just to be disappointed by surprise bacon bits. YET, I still felt responsible for keeping this part of my history alive.

Now, for better or for worse, I am a HUGE foodie. I love learning to cook dishes from around the world and especially love Asian cuisine (yes that is a large umbrella, yes I do love all of it). Going out to eat has gotten harder and harder, but I still feel this overwhelming guilt when I consider breaking kosher. It feels like all of the time I spent living this way would be for nothing, that the sacrifices so many of my ancestors made to keep these traditions alive would go to waste.

For years, I’ve been stuck in this place of indecision. I feel uncomfortable bringing this up to my mom or the rabbi she sees. I’m not close to any of my Jewish family, most of which are very far away, mentally unwell, or dead. My goyim friends encourage breaking kosher and offer ‘first tastes’ of all their favorite treif foods, but don’t understand the kind of pressure I’m under. The only person who gets it is a Muslim friend of mine who is stuck in a similar situation. What should I do?"

Do you believe this has contributed to the performance of the Israeli military in the conflicts it fought during the last decades?

I’m Jewish, my husband is not.  We are raising our children in reform judaism.  For many years I had a complicated feeling about organized religion but kept traditions at home.  My kids are now 4 and 6 and my husband and I have decided we would like them to try religious school at our very welcoming temple and have ties to a Jewish community.  There aren’t a lot of us where we live and though I think I can teach them at home it’s important to have the community.  Which is all background to my current paralyzing panic over the registration forms.  What are their Hebrew names???? My son’s legal/secular name is a Hebrew name. But my husband isn’t Jewish so is he [first name] ben [husband’s very Irish Catholic name]? My daughter has a Hebrew middle name, which was my grandmother’s Hebrew name.  So is she [middle name] bat [my Hebrew name]??? Or do I ask for a belated naming ceremony to sort this out and write a paragraph on the form explaining???

I know almost as many young converts as born Jews. Mostly Reform converts, but a few Conservative converts as well. 

What’s interesting is they’re all rabidly anti Zionist anti Israel, whereas born Jews around me are usually somewhere from solidly supportive of Israel to critical but affirming of its existence. I’ve never met a Zionist convert. I guess I’m trying to understand why and what to do with this going forward. 

 I guess if your family never actually faced anti semitism and were never truly accepted into the countries they lived in, then you don’t truly get why it’s important for Israel to exist. Or because being Jewish is solely a religious identity and not ethnic at all so they aren’t “from” the region. Maybe they think we’re all just Russians, Germans, Tunisians, etc who practice Judaism. These people are all white as well, so they probably would see themselves as white colonizers if they moved to Israel. 

I’m starting to find it frustrating that I have to stay closeted about any Zionist or supportive of Israel thoughts I have. I don’t care that they converted, but to be honest the fact that this dividing line keeps coming up is starting to make me feel like there is something different between those who converted and those who didn’t. What’s even more annoying is they tend to speak for the community and if I say anything even vaguely acknowledging of Israel as anything other than an evil colonist apartheid state etc then the non Jews I know chime in with “well XYZ is Jewish and they hate Israel so.” 

Have you guys experienced this? What do I do? I think I’d lose a lot of friends if I were more open with my true thoughts."

After my parents divorced, my mom returned to Christianity, and nine years later, my father remarried and became atheist. While I have celebrated Hanukkah and Passover a few times, that's about the extent of my involvement in holidays. My dad has never been a significant part of my life. Although I feel more connected to Judaism and its beliefs than Christianity, I know very little about 'my culture(?)’ now that my father is fully out of my life. I practice the religion with the limited knowledge I have to the best of my ability. I'm not even sure what type of Judaism I practice, or if I can even be considered Jewish. Religion and faith holds great importance for me, but my older brother is also an atheist, and the closest synagogue is a two-hour drive away.

1,2023-07-14,Is Genesis 3:15 to be understood as individual or collective?,u/supremexxl47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14yxz6w/is_genesis_315_to_be_understood_as_individual_or/,"I came across a few articles that make the claim that Genesis 3:15 is to be understood as a reference to an individual.  The argument is made from using Hebrew grammar and syntax to support their position. The first claim is that since zera is the subject of a singular verb and the antecedent of a singular pronoun. I am not an expert in Hebrew. If anyone can clear up the confusion, that would be great.

Here is the main arguments of the article;

“To start with the easiest and most obvious, very often when zera‘ is used collectively, it is either the antecedent of plural pronouns, the subject of a plural verb, or both (this despite being itself formally singular). This is an obvious tip-off that the collective sense is meant. However, in Gen. 3:15, zera‘ is the subject of a singular verb and is the antecedent of a singular pronoun. So, the first item to note is that grammar of Gen. 3:15 does not explicitly demand a collective reading as is the case when zera‘ is the subject of plural verbs and/or the antecedent of plural pronouns. Nevertheless, our job is not done because there are not a few times when zera‘ is clearly a collective based upon other contextual considerations, but is in fact the subject of a singular verb and/or is referred to with a singular pronoun. Yet even in these cases, there is more than meets the eye.

Hebrew has two different varieties of pronouns – one form that is used exclusively for possession or as objects of verbs and prepositions (genitive, dative, and accusative functions), and another form that is used only as the subjects of verbs or in predicate nominatives (verbless clauses). Of the instances when zera‘ is used collectively with singular verbs and/or pronouns in the Old Testament, two things are true: (1) zera‘ is the overt subject of those singular verbs (we’ll return to this below); and/or (2) zera‘ is referred to by only one of the two sets of Hebrew pronouns – the first type listed above (those showing possession or as objects of prepositions or verbs). On the other hand, the collective use of zera‘ is never used in conjunction with singular, subject pronouns, the second of the two types referred to above. (There are two possible exceptions to this phenomenon. The first is Lev. 11:37: “Now should a carcasses of theirs fall on any seed [zera‘] for sowing, it [subject pronoun] is clean.” [translation mine] But even here the sense of “any seed,” kôl zera‘, is “even a particular seed.” The other may be Exod. 16:31 (and the same figure in Num. 11:7), “It [manna] was like [a] coriander seed …” [translation mine] But again, what is most likely in view here is the comparison of a single coriander seed and a single piece of manna, not a pile, or the like, of each.)

This applies to our discussion at hand because the pronoun used for the “seed” (zera‘) of the woman in Gen. 3:15 is, in fact, a singular, subject pronoun (the second type of Hebrew pronoun referred to above). Not only is this type of pronoun, when in the singular, never used with the collective nuance of zera‘, but conversely, in those verses where zera‘ is the antecedent of a singular, subject pronoun, every one refers to a particular zera‘, a “child” (e.g., Gen. 21:13; Lev. 17:12, 21:13, 22:24). Thus, the grammatical/syntactical relationship between the subject, pronoun, and verb in Gen. 3:15 is one that belongs to the so-called counting, rather than collective, sense of zera‘.

There is yet another feature that is noteworthy about the pronoun used in Gen. 3:15. Hebrew verbs, much like say, verbs in Spanish, are inflected for person, number, and where relevant, gender. Thus, a subject pronoun used with a verb is completely unnecessary because all of the information about the subject of a Hebrew verb is intrinsically marked in the verb form itself. Nevertheless, the author of Genesis does not leave zera‘ to stand as the subject of the verb it governs alone (here it is “bruise”), but rather adds a grammatically superfluous pronoun to serve as the subject of the verb. It would be akin to saying “Jack, he ran up the hill,” rather than simply, “Jack ran up the hill.” In Biblical Hebrew when this phenomenon takes place the desired effect is either emphasis or the removal of potential ambiguity. In this case, because the singular, subject pronoun along with zera‘ is always used to convey the sense of a particular “child” rather than the collective “offspring/descendants,” the author is removing ambiguity over how zera‘ should be understood. The singular, subject, pronoun is added in order to rule out the collective nuance of zera‘. On the other hand, if the zera‘ of the woman was meant to be understood in a collective sense and thus demand the pronoun “they” rather than “he,” the pattern used in the Old Testament to communicate this is (a) to not have used a subject pronoun at all; and/or (b) to use a plural subject pronoun. The use of the singular, subject pronoun in Gen. 3:15 not only particularizes who will be doing the “bruising,” but also gives marked, limiting, anaphoric information about its antecedent. The grammar of Gen. 3:15 demands that the zera‘ of the woman is not the sum total of her offspring or “descendants,” but rather one, particular zera‘ – a “he.”"

I'm aware of the housing crisis in Israel, where the cost of buying an apartment is very high and most people cannot afford the required deposit. But I'm wondering if mortgage interest rates are as unpredictable as they are in western countries.

After planning the last month or so to come back finally, I see that again, now is just not the best time to return when there is this mess that the judicial overhaul is causing within Israeli society, and how divided and estranged everyone became. I just hope this whole balagan disappears shortly and Israel returns to being the one I’ve known and loved always. Israel was never an easy country to live in but its pros out weighed the cons. For the time being, I hope that changes soon and things take a turn for the better.

In my mind, I’m like wtf, but hopefully he’ll move on. I said something under my breath like “we should step on all their toes…”

Professor continues to talk about how he doesn’t want to piss off nazis.

To me, it seems like he’s trying to get out of the hole he’s digging so I say, trying to help him out - “ok let’s move on”

And instead of taking that as a way to pivot, he doubles down and says “why?”

In shock, I immediately say “I’m extremely uncomfortable.”

He finally changes the subject. All the while my classmates were kind of laughing. I’m hoping it was nervous laughter.

I’ve never been so uncomfortable in class and he’s brought up Jesus 3 times (yes I keep count).

I’m so wired and irritated right now, I’m hoping when I calm down I can write an email to him and maybe someone else who could say he’s not being entirely appropriate.

Provocations by the IDF in areas of the West Bank and East Jerusalem are most often met with local elements and nothing more then a strongly worded letter from neighbors and mostly silence from Iran.

Irans role in this conflict is often being overplayed to try to incite the Israeli people into open conflict with a far away nation to take away from domestic issues.

Hezbollah recently moved a tent closer to the Israeli border and had a number of its operatives injured during an attempt to probe the border fence. These actions are not so threatening as some Israeli media outlets portrays it but are quite meager in motive and effect.

These actors in the region are independent in  motivations and actions trying to make them apart of wider front is an attempt to prevent political discourse and compromise with the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and take away from the seizure of power by the coalition in Israel.

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

We all desire peace, but what exactly does the word ""peace"" mean?

When people use the word ""peace,"" in any language, potentially, there are many  concepts they may have in mind.

I. [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Berlin), a philosopher of the 20th century, made a distinction between Freedom ""from"" and Freedom ""to."" There is a difference between being free from slavery or imposition and having the freedom to pursue one's own life goals. Similarly, we can differentiate between Peace ""from"" and Peace ""for.""

Before delving into this dichotomy, it may be worthwhile to first explore the distinction between objective and subjective peace.

The presence of war or significant threats of violence represents external or objective deficiencies in peace. However, someone who experiences stress, anxiety, or psychological disruption might be externally at peace, but subjectively cannot be considered to be in a state of peace.

We can attain high levels of internal, subjective peace if our material conditions are sufficient to ensure that we and our loved ones will not lack basic necessities such as food and shelter. However, our attitude towards this reality plays a crucial role. Often, despite little justification for anxiety, we fear we will fail to meet these basic needs. Society convinces us that we need much more than necessary, leading to stress as we strive to reduce the minimal risks to our basic needs and continually pursue more possessions.

One approach to achieving peace is to restructure our mindset so that we recognize that most sources of stress or anxiety are merely over-activated instincts.

Adopting such a [stoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) attitude may result in complete subjective peace for our minds, but it may be criticized as a form of apathy. Do we truly want to view the suffering of others with indifference? Should it be our goal to ignore the obligations we have to fulfill?

What has been described so far can be referred to as Peace ""from."" It represents freedom from stress, anxiety, and mental suffering. However, there is also a different concept, which might be called: Peace ""for.""

Peace ""for"" is not just a state of being like peace ""from,"" but rather a motivation or value. We may wish *for* peace for ourselves, *for* our loved ones, and *for* everyone. Striving to achieve peace *for* others requires hard work and may lead to high levels of stress as we set goals and milestones as part of a plan to bring about peace. Peace ""from"" and Peace ""for"" naturally contain an inherent contradiction.

It is likely that we need both peace *from* and peace *for*. A good balance might help achieve both aspects of peace."

My mother converted to Judaism before I was born, and although my brother had a Reform brit mila (circumcision), he had to undergo hatafat dam brit (a symbolic ritual) before his (conservative) bar mitzvah to fulfill the requirements. Recently, I became aware of the long-lasting trauma this experience caused him. It even caused him to completely disengage from Judaism shortly after his bar mitzvah.

This has led me to question the practice, particularly when it involves children. I don't want to focus on the traditional brit mila performed at 8 days old since infants are unlikely to retain conscious memory of the event. I just want to focus on the issue of informed consent when it comes to children. How can a child truly give informed consent for a procedure that involves their sexual organ? In other contexts, children are legally unable to give consent for sexual activities.

I am genuinely interested in hearing your thoughts on this matter. Do you find this practice acceptable as it stands? Do you believe it should be reevaluated and modified? Or do you consider it to be barbaric and advocate for its discontinuation? I'm open to perspectives that fall anywhere in between.

I would like this to be a respectful and thoughtful dialogue to gain a deeper understanding of different viewpoints within our community.

Long story short I’ve been interviewing with some Israeli companies and have reached the offer stage where they now want to discuss salary. 

For one of those companies it took them about 10 days for them to get back to me (and I had to chase them). I told them prior I had another pending offer that was x amount so they could take that into consideration when taking 10 whole days to decide what salary they could pay and the answer at the end was “sorry we can’t pay you that salary you should take the other offer”!!!

It’s a niche role and my experience for it is second to none as I had done very similar at a company 10x theirs, I was astounded they would just give me up like that and not even try and say “we can’t offer you what you want but we can offer x”. At least give a figure?!

The second company offered me a low salary. I said no. They then said give us time to see if we can improve it, some days later came back and said they’d increase salary 50% (indicative of really wanting a candidate, right?) I then accepted and then they ghost me for 2 days!

When they finally replied they then said “we are just waiting to see the answer from another candidate”.

So basically after negotiating with me, increasing salary as they know I’m above competent for the role, and getting an agreement they now want to consider others? (to get cheaper clearly). 

I’m just astounded how SHITTY, unprofessional and ZERO URGENCY all of this is.  Both these “offers” have been pending for nearly a month now. 

Is it just me who is unlucky or is this the norm?

The issue arose when I applied for the visa and they asked for my permit of stay in Italy. They require a validity for 1 year and as a student the maximum duration for my permit is 1 year. So, unless I were to pick up my permit on the way to the airport I cannot have a permit for longer than 1 year from the date of travelling.

I do not believe this is necessarily a bad thing. Opposition breeds strength of spirit and character.

I (24/M, EU Master's degree, non-US) have a job offer from a mid-sized Israeli company that's willing to initiate the work visa process on my behalf. I'm from a country that doesn't require a tourist visa to go to Israel, if this is relevant info.

Now, I've heard horror stories about how difficult it is to obtain a work visa for Israel as a non-Jewish person.  I also most likely don't qualify for the Hi-Tech visa, so we would have to go for the regular B1 (I believe) work visa.

I wanted to inquire about your experiences and find out if it's really THAT DIFFICULT (almost impossible) to get it, even with a standing job offer and an employer who's willing to go through all potential costs of hiring me. And is it true that the Israeli government only issues a very limited number each year? Also, if you have any tips on how to best argue on the need of hiring me, I'd be more than happy to hear them.

In general, just looking for any type of info that would acquaint me better with the visa process and allow me to estimate my chances of getting one. The info I found online is somewhat confusing, and also different websites say different things.

But I have a genuine fear about the future of Israel, and history teaches us that in many cases it's important to make the right decision while it's not too late.

It's not just the reform that makes me afraid. Even before the reform, it's clear that Israel becomes more religious, more fanatical, more fundamental, more messianic, more God-is-with-us-so-fuck-reality type of thinking. The reform is probably the result of these processes which are happening anyway, and they'll increase in the near/far future.

If you think I'm wrong about the above predictions, so ignore my question. 

But if you think I'm right, if you think this prediction is the likely scenario, so help me out here:

What are the reasons not to leave?"

I’m living in Haifa. 25 yo.As an Ole Hadash( 3,5 years in, from January 2020) I want an advice from locals who lives here. 
What kind of job would give me maximum possible amount of money? Long story short, after my repatriation from Ukraine I studied Hebrew for 6 month and then worked 2,5 years at the tampon’s factory. 1 years of it’s time as a machine operator, a year as Roshcevet, and 6 month as a technician. I speak 4 languages (Russian, Ukrainian, English and Hebrew). In Ukraine I worked as a cellular technician and seller at the  store (2015-2020)which was at the radio market.
Alongside with that i graduated from technical college and have a degree as a “mechanic”(car repair).
My problem may sounds stupid, but I have no relevant degree.
My story:
The problem is, my city Donetsk  was under the occupation from 2014 till today, war killed all infrastructure, economy and educational system alongside with 50k people( it’s even before second war from February 2022)
War and immediate occupation started at the end of April 2014 at this time I was finishing my first year in college. Few month later with ongoing war my family lost everything, we had no possibility’s to leave, and actually didn’t want it, even though  my parents lost their jobs, we knew no one awaits us somewhere to give us fresh start.
Seven month later, even under bombing, war and Russian occupation, schools and university’s were reopened, and I went to my second year in college, knowing that I will have no relevant degree, because occupied area already had name as self-pronounced Donetsk People Republic, which just could not  give a relevant degree to the students. Knowing all that, by accident I started working at the radio market as a side hustle at 16 yo, after college and full days at Saturdays and Sundays.Since my dad is an engineer he taught me a lot of real skills, so repairing IPhones and other phones wasn’t a problem. Alongside with that I was working as a seller at the same store (if needed)
So till 2017 I studied car repair in college and after it worked at the radio market. I wasn’t making enough money so after graduating and receiving a diploma of Donetsk People Republic I  decided to go to occupied Crimea for season as a waiter, in order to make a lot of money at summer, I made deal with my boss at the store that I will return back 6 mont later. After my return (October 2017)I continued working at this store until April 2018, when my boss decided to leave the city and under some agreement he gave this store to me. All of that was under occupation, so money i or even my boss were making was just pathetic compare to even Ukraine or Russia.
But I was making twice more than any ordinary person, so idea of being boss seduced me, and next 6 month I worked at the same position but as a boss, which in me eyes wasn’t bad for a 20years old. Even being a boss didn’t bring me enough money(400-500$) Despite me ego I decided to go into Moscow to work, I knew I could make there 1000$,at the same time my family made Aliyah, but knowing that back home I’m still being a boss of a little store, which I handled to my friend for a while, stopped me from repatriation process.Six month in Moscow, haven’t matched my expectations, I woked there as a waiter, delivery guy and eventually as a cellular technician for 4 month. Moscow it’s a cold, unfriendly city, especially for the people without any documents or connections. So I decided to move back into Donetsk and worked at this place back again. The idea of living under the occupation, with corruption and criminals was killing my mental state. Bombing, war, no infrastructure or banking system, criminal activities, police which framed people in order to make 100$, soldiers who killed, raped or robed everyone they wanted eventually made me understand that I can’t live like that. So I decided to move in Israel after all in January 2020.I’m a legit Jew by the way.What I did in Israel I already wrote at the beginning
In Israel at any interview mostly, people ask me if I have degree or not, have I’ve been in army or not or did I work in Israel. All my previous experience is just irrelevant, and  as you see my story can’t be described in a short way.
What would you recommend to me? 
Thank you, I know my story telling isn’t great.
P.S. I need a lot of money in order to leave the country."

My feedback is to just be a little more patient, and WAIT until the conditions are better to pass.

1,2023-07-15,Rediscovering the Undiscovered Jewish Communities of Burkina Faso - A Fascinating Journey of Survival and Identity,u/africanman109,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1501t6m/rediscovering_the_undiscovered_jewish_communities/,"Hey, fellow Redditors! Today, I want to share with you an incredible story of undiscovered Jewish communities in Burkina Faso, whose ancestors fled from Mali in search of a safe haven. Many of you might be familiar with the rich Jewish history in Mali, particularly in Timbuktu, but did you know that some Jewish descendants still reside in neighboring Burkina Faso?

The Jewish presence in Mali can be traced back to the 8th century, when African-Jewish Radhanites settled in Timbuktu during the time of the Songhai Empire. These multicultural traders established a thriving trading center and network of routes through the desert. However, their peaceful existence was disrupted in 1492, when the Expulsion of Jews from Spain led to an influx of Sephardi Jews seeking refuge in Mali.

During the 14th and 15th centuries, Timbuktu became home to a vibrant Sephardi Jewish community. However, their safety was short-lived. In 1492, Askia Muhammad I, ruler of the Songhai Empire, threatened Jews with death if they did not convert to Islam. Faced with persecution, many Jews chose to flee rather than forsake their faith. The ruler's hostility towards the Jewish community was evident in the words of the Andalusi historian Leo Africanus, who described the harsh measures taken against Jews.

A significant number of Iberian Sephardi Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal found solace in Tindirma, Mali, where they established a Jewish community in 1496. Over the years, the community flourished, and a new synagogue and Jewish cemetery were established in Timbuktu under the protection of Moroccan Rabbi Mordechai Abi Serour in 1860.

Unfortunately, by the early 1900s, no organized Jewish community remained in Mali. It was not until the 1960s that the ethnic consciousness of Jewish descendants in Tindirma was reignited when local fishermen threatened to build a village atop Al Yahudi Cemetery. This sparked a strong opposition from the Jewish community.

In the 1990s, a remarkable revival of Jewish identity took place in Timbuktu. Many ""Hidden Jews"" began reconnecting with their Jewish roots, even though they predominantly identified as Muslims. Ismael Diadie Haidara, a historian from Timbuktu, played a pivotal role in this rediscovery. He founded Zakhor (Timbuktu Association for Friendship with the Jewish World), an organization that aims to uncover Mali's forgotten Jewish history, previously concealed to avoid persecution.

In 1996, Zakhor published a manifesto declaring themselves Jews and proclaiming their lineage as descendants of the Jews of Tuat, a region in western Algeria on the edge of the Sahara. Since then, the organization and other Jewish descendants in Mali have been dedicated to preserving their heritage and shedding light on their remarkable history.

It is within this context that we turn our attention to Burkina Faso. As the Jews fled from Mali, some sought refuge in this neighboring country, settling in pockets throughout the land. Interestingly, when Seventh Day Adventist missionaries arrived in Burkina Faso, they discovered these hidden Jewish communities, who were already observing the Sabbath.

The presence of these undiscovered Jewish communities in Burkina Faso represents a fascinating chapter in Jewish history. It speaks to the resilience of a people who managed to maintain their traditions and identity, even in the face of adversity and dispersion.

So, what are your thoughts on these undiscovered Jewish communities in Burkina Faso? Have you ever heard of their existence before? Let's engage in a vibrant discussion and learn more about this incredible piece of history together!

When you are unsatisfied with your Netflix subscription you simply cancel it, but what you can do when you are unsatisfied with how your government spends your tax money?

probably your intuitive thoughts would be a protest, strike, or maybe leaving the country!

The ugly truth is we can't do much, we can't stop paying our taxes even when it comes to stations where the government diced to pay monthly salaries to a specific sector in the public for doing nothing.

In a nutshell, the purpose of taxes is to be invested in the public, to build schools, hospitals, roads, etc, everyone pays and everyone has the right to use the services that the government provided.

**This model of community agreement fails** when part of the community succeeds in still getting his part of the services without doing their duty to the community, or when one part or more gets invested in more than what they contribute on purpose.  


**Do we still live in a democracy?!**"

I posted on this sub before, and resources that you recommended I read before I get into Tanakh are currently shipping, but since I'm near the beginning of my journey with HaShem, I have a lot to learn.

What are Judaism's views on food sacrificed to idols or made in idolatrous religious institutions? Is it considered idolatry if a Ben Noach eats food like that? I couldn't find anything on Sefaria that touched on this topic, and internet searches on this are useless because all the results are from Christian pages, no matter how much I adjust the search terms. Some meds on pharmacy shelves over here come from religious institutions (mostly Christian ones, but some Buddhist ones as well), and sometimes, none of that is indicated on the exterior packaging, so what should I do if I got meds, am ready to take them, and once I open them up, I learn they're from an institution like that? The extreme case of someone offering me food sacrificed to a physical idol is unlikely to ever happen, but what should I do in such a situation? What about if a Christians prays before a meal and asks their three idolatrous deities to bless the meal, but they realize they can't finish it all before it goes bad and offer me the leftovers? Maybe, I'm just overthinking this, but I'd obviously much rather ask you for the Jewish perspective than risk accidentally committing idolatry"

I’ve already lost count at how many N-words and “schvartzas” were said in conversation, directly to me. This is something that would’ve tremendously upset both of my parents. I was taught at a very young age how disgusting these words and beliefs were I was taught to be a good decent human being. I felt their Neshamas come down in the actual
Moment. 

But I kept my mouth shut or more often just walked away. Typically, I’m one to aggressively call out crap like that and get very confrontational if need be. I don’t know why but in this scenario I just kept it moving. Maybe because I already knew the BS apologies/rationalizations to follow and  I just don’t have the patience to deal with clowns anymore. I’m beat up. I lost my dad 4 months ago. Lost my
Job 6 weeks ago. I got engaged 5 weeks ago. Then lost my mom 1 month ago. All I want is for these events to be over as soon as possible and to be as far away from some of these people as possible. 

These are people I haven’t seen in over 20 years and likely have no clue my fiancé is black but that shouldn’t even matter. It just guts me, for humanity. For my wife. For god willing my future biracial children. 

I truly can’t comprehend the level of ignorance I just encountered in a 20 min span. 

Where did this all start? When? Do they all teach their kids this nonsense too? Do the rabbis support it? Surely they must know their congregations are filled with bigots right? Surely they know the dangers involved in allowing these people to spew hate, right?"
1,2023-07-15,Help me settle a debate with my sister,u/heckyouyourself,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/150j7nb/help_me_settle_a_debate_with_my_sister/,"My younger sister and I were chatting about social issues today, and my sister referred to us as being “basic white people”. We’re both fully ethnically Jewish, and we definitely look it. We have very light skin though. I told her that nazis don’t consider us white at all. She looked at me like I said something incredibly dumb and said “we’re white. Our race is white.” I said “what even is race though?” She kept laughing and looking at me like I’m dumb, and I let it go because she wasn’t taking me seriously. 

When I was younger, my mom and I got screamed at with antisemitic abuse by a stranger who could tell we were Jewish. My sister was not present for this. It’s a source of some trauma for me, and for a while afterwards I was afraid to go in public. My sister is the only member of our family that’s never been subjected to real-world antisemitism, and I think it shows in some ways. She constantly refers to herself as being privileged, and always downplays the stuff Jewish people go through, saying that other marginalized groups have it much worse. 

Truthfully, I always thought of myself as a standard white girl as well, but I spoke with some people on this sub recently and have come to think of myself a bit differently. I think it’s just complicated. My point isn’t that we’re people of color, my point is that calling ourselves basic white people, as she did, lacks nuance. I tried to articulate this, but my sister thinks I’m being insensitive, and that I should own up to my white privilege instead of trying to identify out of it. I can honestly see both sides, and I see where she’s coming from, I just think she’s making it too simple. I was hoping some people here could weigh in. Who’s side would you agree with more here?"

1,2023-07-15,Israel *IS* uniquely racist.,u/ihaveneverexisted,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/150mj8u/israel_is_uniquely_racist/,"Israel maintains a series of legal policies and organisations which are clearly and undeniably designed to benefit Jewish over non-Jewish citizens. If you don't think that doing so is racist(or bigoted/ethnic supremacist, I'm using race and ethnicity interchangeably here) then that's a conversation to have another time. If you do, then Israel does so to an extent greater that any other state I have encountered.

 Many of the following policies are unique to Israel, nvm states seen as ""liberal"" and a western ally receiving billions in military aid yearly. Here are a few examples, these are all part of official policy/law and apply in ""Israel proper"" + East Jerusalem, and have their intentions abundantly clear. This is, so to speak, the tip of the iceberg. The most obvious examples of racist legislation. This ignores the difference in the way Palestinian and Jewish diaspora are treated(so no, the issue discussed here is not ROR), the WB(-East Jerusalem), past policies and public sentiment (such as a plurality supporting ethnic cleansing of Arabs) or the often racist rhetoric of ministers when they are unrelated to a specific policy they enforce/design. (such as calls for genocide). I am, as of yet, unaware of a single state which maintains a policy which corresponds to any of these, nvm which maintains all of these. If their are any they are for sure a very small minority of countries, and therefore together with Israel are uniquely racist. 

1) Seizure of Palestinian land. Palestinian land has, and continues to be, systematically seized for the sole benefit of the Jewish people. This has been done in a variety of ways, but has in conclusion meant that Palestinian citizens of Israel are denied the same rights to land that Jewish citizens have, if both(or their fathers/grandfathers) were found to have not been in their homes during the war. This is of course especially egregious since Palestinians were systematically ethnically cleansed and expelled from their homes and denied access.

Israel’s seizure of thousands of dunams of land from Palestinians in 1948 and in subsequent decades in Israel and the OPT have aimed to serve the exclusive interest of Jewish Israelis. Reflecting just on the situation inside Israel, a 2003 Israeli government-commissioned report found that “the expropriation activities were clearly and explicitly harnessed to the interests of the Jewish majority, and the land was transferred to entities such as the Jewish National Fund (JNF), which according to its own definition serves Jewish settlement, or the Israel Land Administration, which, judging from its administration patterns, served a similar objective.”[\[118\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn118) The Israel Land Administration manages and allocates 93 percent of the land in Israel,[\[119\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn119) meaning this government-commission report found that the state uses the overwhelming majority of land in Israel to serve only one community, Jewish Israelis. [https://www.nrc.no/globalassets/pdf/legal-opinions/absentee\_law\_memo.pdf](https://www.nrc.no/globalassets/pdf/legal-opinions/absentee_law_memo.pdf)

 Legal means were instituted in the early years of the state to expropriate Palestinian lands and hand them over to Israeli owners. The Emergency Regulations for the Cultivation of Fallow Lands, 1948, empowered the Ministry of Agriculture to seize lands not (or “under-”) cultivated to “ensure” their cultivation. When used in conjunction with the “Security Areas Regulations” and the Regulations on Closed Areas, which prevented Palestinians from reaching their fields, these regulations proved an effective means of confiscation. In 1950 a Development Authority was created, later becoming the Israel Lands Authority, with the intent of acquiring “abandoned” Arab territories and lands and “developing” them. ... Regulations issued in 1953 allowed the state to expropriate the lands of 250 “abandoned” Arab villages and individual parcels of land belonging to “absentees,” equaling 1500 square kilometers or 586 square miles 

 The ‘Israeli Absentee Property Law 1950’ (‘Absentee Property Law’) is the main law in a series of laws that regulate the treatment of property belonging to Palestinians who left, were forced to flee, or were deported during the 1948 War. These Palestinian refugees left behind a great deal of property and the Absentee Property Law has served as the legal basis for transferring such property into the possession of the State of Israel. In recent years, the Absentee Property Law has become a significant obstacle, hindering Palestinians from successfully establishing rights to property or land, particularly in East Jerusalem. This has had serious effects on, amongst other things, obtaining Israeli-issued licenses to build, completing property transactions and planning procedures. Given the automatic application of the Absentee Property Law to property considered to be “absentee property,” people often only find out that they have lost ownership of their property when trying to deal with it (e.g. sell, transfer, build on it). [https://www.nrc.no/globalassets/pdf/legal-opinions/absentee\_law\_memo.pdf](https://www.nrc.no/globalassets/pdf/legal-opinions/absentee_law_memo.pdf)

 

2)The JNF. 

 ""Semi-governmental bodies like the JNF, Jewish Agency, and WZO that serve the Jewish community and no other constituency, play central roles in this effort. A 1953 Knesset law endows JNF, or Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael in Hebrew, with governmental authorities,[\[120\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn120) and Israel’s Basic Law: Israel Lands (1960) notes that ownership over its land “shall not be transferred either by sale or in any other manner.”[\[121\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn121) JNF owns 13 percent of Israeli land, which the Israel Land Authority (ILA) manages. JNF makes up nearly half the governing board of the ILA, which controls 93 percent of the land in Israel.[\[122\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn122) [https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution)

The explicit mandate of the JNF is to develop and lease land for Jews and not any other segment of the population. Under the terms of its Memorandum and Articles of Association, the JNF acquires property “for the purpose of settling Jews on such lands and properties.”[\[123\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn123) In a 2004 court filing, the JNF made clear that it “is not a public body that works for the benefit of all citizens of the state. The loyalty of JNF is given to the Jewish people and only to them is the JNF obligated.”[\[124\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn124) The JNF long interpreted its mandate as allowing it to block Palestinians from purchasing, renting, or building on their lands.[\[125\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn125) Following a lawsuit brought by rights groups though, Israeli authorities have allowed non-Jews to use JNF land on condition that, if sold to them, the ILA will compensate JNF with land of equal value elsewhere.[\[126\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn126) *Haaretz*, though, has reported that Palestinians have faced “red tape” far exceeding what Jews face when purchasing JNF land, delaying registration by years or more.[\[127\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn127)""[https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution)

3) The WZO

 Israeli law also affords semi-governmental status to the World Zionist Organization (WZO) and the Jewish Agency. A 1952 law establishes the organizations, then a single entity, as “the authorised agent” of the state “for the development and settlement of the country” and “absorption of immigrants from the Diaspora.”[\[131\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn131) The WZO’s Settlement Division, operating under the direct control of the Israeli government, established most settlements and manages the allocation of land for settlements with the stated purpose to “establish and strengthen Jewish settlement in the country’s periphery through strengthening the hold on state lands given to it by the government.”[\[137\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn137) The government provides the division with its entire budget, which amounted to 441.6 million Israeli New Shekel (NIS) (US$132.60 million) between 2009-18.[\[138\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn138) Since the early 2000s, the WZO has played a more active role as well in the Negev and the Galilee; the Israeli newspaper *Haaretz* has described them as “the government’s executive arm for construction in the West Bank, as well as in the Negev and the Galilee.”[\[139\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn139)""

 3.5)Shimon Peres, then deputy prime minister, described the development of the Negev and the Galilee as a “battle for the future of the Jewish people.”[\[148\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn148) The Jewish Agency has said that it sought to guarantee a “Zionist majority” in the Negev and the Galilee, launching its own programs in these areas “to get around the problem that the government must act on behalf of all citizens of the state of Israel while the WZO is entitled to act for the sake of the Jewish people.”[\[149\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn149) The government approved the WZO establishing settlements in these areas.[\[150\]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution#_ftn150) 

4) Religious councils in Jewish communities and only Jewish communities are funded by the state. Therefore discriminating against non-Jewish communities.  

Religious services law which ""Authorizes the Ministry of Religious Affairs to establish religious councils in Jewish towns, cities, and settlements. Funded by state and local governing bodies, these religious councils serve the local population in all religious matters, such as maintaining religious institutions, cemeteries and graves in each locality. There is no parallel law to authorize the establishment of non-Jewish religious councils of this kind. ""  [https://www.adalah.org/en/law/view/522](https://www.adalah.org/en/law/view/522)

5) Jerusalem Racial quotas

 In Jerusalem, the government’s plan for the municipality, including both the west and occupied east of the city, sets the goal of “maintaining a solid Jewish majority in the city” and a target demographic “ratio of 70% Jews and 30% Arabs”—later adjusted to a 60:40 ratio after authorities acknowledged that “this goal is not attainable” in light of “the demographic trend.” [https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution)

6) Zionist settlements, which are of course maintained solely for Jewish communities, receiving tax subsidies.

 The law, which passed in July 2012, grants a 35% tax exemption on donations to institutions that promote “Zionist settlement”. The law differentiates between public institutions on political and ideological grounds, contradicting the intended purpose of tax benefits to serve social goals such as promoting education, culture and religion. This proposed distinction violates the principle of equality between public institutions, regardless of the basis of their work. [https://www.adalah.org/en/law/view/489](https://www.adalah.org/en/law/view/489)

7) Right to national self-determination is reserved only for Jewish people, explicitly and legally so.

Only Jews are allowed self-determination, therefore, non-jews are afforded less rights by the state based solely on their ethnic makeup.

 [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-politics-law-idUSKBN1K901V](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-politics-law-idUSKBN1K901V)

These policies, afaik, are quite unique, if not utterly so, amongst other states.

 I have here 6/7 specific policies and state mandated/supported organisations(to which their no non-jewish corresponding organisations) which explicitly and legally benefit Jewish over non-Jewish citizens. I have yet to see a single state that maintains a single policy which corresponds to any one of these above. Is their a single state which enforces racial quotas(nvm in its capital), or explicitly and legally denies 20% of the native population the right to national self-determination, or which explicitly provides funding and tax subsidies for the settlement and religious services of only one ethnic group, or which legally enforces that more than 13% of its land must be used solely for the benefit of one ethnic group, whilst another 93% is controlled in large part by people who maintain the Jewish supremacy of the prior policy. Are their any other states which systematically retain and steal land from a group due to their ethnic identity, or which carries out policies corresponding to ""judaization""(ik Russia is guilty of this in Crimea and occupied Ukraine, hardly seen as liberal). 

If their is, I don't know of it, and it certainly is out of the norm."

OP is autistic. OP has a difficulty in understanding the complexity of interpersonal dynamics. What OP is about to ask may frustrate you. Herein, OP apologizes to you in advance.

-Background Context-
King David called Jonathan “the beloved gift (brother)” from God. Unfortunately, Jonathan passes away in the war with the Philistines, leaving his ONLY CHILD, Mephibosheth, behind. 

-PLOT TWIST-

Mephibosheth, a disabled orphan of the abolished monarchy, is neglected for about 15 years after his father died. Mephiboshet spent his entire childhood and adolescence in Lo-Debar, the nothingville. 

-Question 

If David truly considered Jonathan as his own brother, would he not have looked for his only son immediately following his death?"

So me and my parents are planning to visit Israel at some point in the relatively near future. I tried to search this topic in the sub before posting and didn't see anything super similar, but if it exists than apologies for not seeing it. However, I have some questions since my parents have Syria as their birthplace in their US passports (they have lived here for well over 35 years at this point). How much difficulty will they face coming into Israel given the issues between the two nations (also me as well despite my lack of Syrian birthplace since we're going together and all have the same last name)? Are they going to be barred on that basis? I don't think it matters, but we're Assyrian Christians, and Jerusalem has a lot of important religious sites to us which is our main reason for visiting. 

We also had the desire to visit Lebanon on the trip after Israel, so I was curious of if it's true Israel doesn't stamp into passports anymore. If they do, then would visiting Lebanon first be an automatic bar of entry into Israel? We'd be visiting family who live there. We hold no ill will to the country, just the sites have religious meaning to us."

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tykkndfa2acb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd4171ae47c009a796d9057c615e7719cc747c1e

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

There is a common notion in military thinking that soldiers do not fight for their country, but for their comrades. Unpacking this idea a little leads to the realization that the bonds between individuals involved in a project play a significant role in their motivation, regardless of their initial reasons for participating.

In any collaborative task or long-term mission involving two people, their motivations will never be identical.

For example, if you hire someone to tend to your garden, your motivation is primarily to have a beautiful garden, while the gardener's motivations may include being paid and having enough food for the week. Even in a more symmetrical relationship, such as two partners building a business, the mix of motivations they bring to the job will not be identical.

Unfortunately, when individuals work towards a goal, there may be better ways to achieve that goal that others in the project might not be interested in. For instance, if your goal is to get paid and you believe that the team members could do the job just as well, you might choose to work less as long as your slacking goes unnoticed.

The typical solution to this problem is to monitor each other. By reducing the opportunities for team members to pursue different goals based on your lack of knowledge, you can minimize this issue. However, it may be helpful to consider the dynamics of cooperative behavior before fully embracing omniscient monitoring.

Over the course of a project, individuals' motivations change and evolve. When managed effectively, the interpersonal dynamics between team members become a component of these motivations. If team members begin to see themselves as part of a larger whole, helping one another becomes a shared goal on some level. Team members may become less driven by their own interests and more motivated by the interests of the other team members. They may not be explicitly aware of this change, as it taps into deep instinctual reactions.

On the other hand, monitoring team members excessively sends a message of distrust. This response weakens the human bonds that may have otherwise developed. When people are not trusted, they become less trustworthy.

It would be incorrect to suggest that this idealistic notion of team dynamics applies universally. There are situations where people display more cooperation when there are fewer opportunities to cheat. Thus, in some cases, increased monitoring can improve the chances of project success.

However, it is worth considering the effect of mistrust on our other goals. While implementing a system with less trust may achieve a specific objective, what impact does this have on our overall goals?

A world with more trust among individuals may fall short in achieving certain goals, but it would undoubtedly be a more pleasant world to live in."

Vice news journalist Hind Hassan embeds herself in the WB and in Israel to provide a glimpse of what is occurring in this conflict and provide first hand accounts from Palestinians and Israeli politicians and citizens about the situation. 

She begins by joining a group of Palestinians who are protesting settlers and IDF presence by slinging rocks at soldiers. She continues to a rally where speaker Ben Gvir is advocating for the settlements and annoyed by her constant questioning on the Palestinian issue has her removed.

Hind Hassan has an interview with Naftali Bennet former Israeli Prime Minister where he reiterates that civilian deaths from operations are not done on purpose and that he does not believe in a Palestinian state in the same capacity that Israel has statehood. 

The final part of the documentary is an interview with Elias Ashkar who was unknowingly trying resuscitate his father with ER doctors to no avail. His father was not a combatant in any capacity. 

This raises the question that the IDF may be purposefully targeting civilians and its military occupation in the West Bank is causing unnecessary bloodshed. The Israeli government not allowing for a Palestinian government to operate in its full capacity as a state also raises issues with how the conflict will proceed. 

If a two state solution is off the table then what is going to happen instead. How are Palestinians going to proceed and how should they?

I'm originally from the States and come from a more reform background, but as I've gotten older I've tried to reengage alot more with things like Kashrut.

There is absolutely no kosher anything in any store or bazaar in all of Central Asia, so I generally just stick to being a vegetarian. That being said, the dominant religion here is Islam so almost all meat here is certified halal.

I read once that alot of imams in the States more or less said that in a world with no halal, kosher is allowed because Jews do it right. Is there anything similar on our part? Is halal meat close enough or is the only way to stay vegetarian?

Before I continue though, I’d like to write a joke, a quote and a point that are important in context.  
**The joke**:  
A Russian and an American are arguing. The American says “we have freedom of speech in my country that you don’t: we can criticise our president!”.   
The Russian says “if that’s your metric, then we too have freedom of speech in our country. More than in yours too, because we can criticise your president even more than you can!”  
**The quote**:  
“The amount of violations of human rights in a country is always an inverse function of the amount of complaints about human rights violations heard from there. The greater the number of complaints being aired, the better protected are human rights in that country”  
\- Daniel Patrick Moynihan  
**The point**:  
SoP is a deeply fascist authoritarian regime. That joke could just as well be about Palestine. And the quote explains why. Significant criticism of the Palestinian Authority leads to [torture](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/01/palestinian-authority-routinely-tortures-detainees-says-human-rights-watch#:~:text=The%20report%20alleged%20that%20Palestinian,intimidate%20critics%20and%20opponents%20and) or [death](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizar_Banat). We don't know the full scale of the SoP's debasement of human rights because reporting them is dangerous and in the case of those in Gaza - far more so.

But we know enough.

\----

If you look at the territory of the SoP, ie territories it fully or partially controls (Gaza, Area A & Area B) you notice something interesting:

* 99.9% Arab
* 98.5% Sunni Muslim

That is as close to homogeneity as you get. So we can say with absolute certainty that SoP is not multicultural. This is problematic as lack of contact with ""the other"" breeds intolerance, or has done so historically.

But the key to SoP racism... is the status of Jews owning property in Palestine. Consider:

* There are Palestinian fatwas or laws with [penalties up to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_land_laws) for selling land or property to Israelis, but 
* It seems [Arab Israelis can buy](https://www.timesofisrael.com/lured-by-cheap-prices-and-luxury-digs-arab-israelis-are-snapping-up-west-bank-homes/) properties openly, the restrictions still exist, but they can be overlooked - especially if buying an apartment.

Now lets talk about some complex facts:

* One (of many) Palestinian negotiation red lines is that all settlers (i.e. Jews) must leave \[aka ""ethnic cleansing""\], presumably because:
   * Jews can't own land/property in Palestine, and/or
   * Palestine wants to preserve its 99.9% Arab | 98.5% Sunni Muslim constituency
* When Palestinian politicians are asked why Jews can't stay, the typical response is that invaders/belligerents can't stay. The same argument that Israel did \*not\* use when it formed with a 20% Arab minority after a war in which the Arab League belligerently invaded Israel.
* It is also the case that Palestinian leaders clam up when asked about RoR for descendants of Jews turfed out of Palestine by Palestinian Arabs and Jordanians - i.e. the descendants of Jews of [Kfar Etzion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kfar_Etzion_massacre) on whose remains Gush Etzion (a ""settlement"") was built.
* Unreasonable expectations, vis-a-vis the effects of 1948. Like it or not, Palestinians were an outgrowth of the Arab League's desire to restore some version of the Arab Empire in the form of a Federation, and even though Palestinians were not sovereign, they were a party to the war:
   * Palestinians had zero problem when Arabs ethnically cleansed Jews from Palestine and other Arab countries, and
   * Israelis had zero problem resettling those ethnically cleansed Jews, and
   * Palestinians kicked up a massive stink when Jews ethnically cleansed Arabs from Palestine, and
   * Palestinians (and the Arab League) have a problem resettling those ethnically cleansed Arabs...
   * ... which begs the question as to why Palestinian leadership holds Jews responsible for the welfare of Arabs in a war started by the Arabs.

There are a few other items:

* It's generally bad practise to [elect Holocaust Deniers](https://web.archive.org/web/20090904093310/http://jta.org/news/article/2009/08/31/1007549/hamas-condemns-un-for-teaching-the-holocaust) or those who [wrote a book denying it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Side:_The_Secret_Relationship_Between_Nazism_and_Zionism). The Palestinians did.
* It's especially bad to (in 2023) be advertising said book on [the presidential government website](https://president.ps/books.aspx).
* Much of popularly-elected [Hamas's policy and ideology against Jews](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/protocols-of-the-elders-of-zion), draws against \*The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\* - the most notorious and widely distributed antisemitic publication of modern times.
* There is deeply antisemitic hate content in Palestinian [school textbooks](https://www.eureporter.co/politics/european-parliament-2/2022/04/01/palestinian-authority-slammed-by-eu-budget-committee-for-new-textbooks-with-increased-hate-speech-and-violence/), and the problem seems to be getting worse.
* The antisemitic hate content is likely feeding Palestine's status of the most, or [one of the most](https://global100.adl.org/country/west-bank-and-gaza/2014) antisemitic societies on the planet.
* And then the ""best till last"" -> the Pay to Slay policy. This is where the Martyrs' Fund administered by the PLO pays additional stipends to Arabs or to their families based on number of Jews murdered and the location in which they murdered them. Basically, the law dictates that the deadlier the terror attack, the richer the reward.

FYI, Jews are not the only people, against whom racism is openly shown by Palestinian politicians. Palestinian Ahmadiya [cop it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmadiyya_in_Palestine) pretty hard as well.

I've tried to not stray into ""who said what"" territory and ignored the innumerable racist statements of Palestinian leaders. Frankly, what someone says is generally less relevant than what someone does.

The above is more than enough to show how deeply, legally and practically, racism is in the fabric of Palestinian politics and society."

חדר רגיעה - צינוק. לא נרגעים שם, רק עוברים אחיזות. צרחות מהחדר רגיעה זה משהו שאפילו בסרטי אימה לא תשמעו. כמובן שבשביל חניכים מהפנימיה זה יום שישי רגיל. 
אחיזה - מיועדת להרגיע של הנער. בולשיט. במציאות - בא גבר 1.92 מטר והחבר שלו . תופסים לך את הידיים והרגליים ומעקמים אותם בצורה כזאת שאת חושבת שהן עוד שניה נשברות. הכאב לא נורמלי. שמים לך ברך על הצוואר לחניקה אפקטיבית. את יכולה לצרוח שאת נחנקת, את יכולה להתחנן שירפו במעט, אבל הם יפסיקו רק שעתיים אחרי שתסתמי את הפה. 
הפרדה - כיף חיים לא נורמלי. על מעשים קיצוניים כגון בריחה או אי ציות למדריך, את מקבלת את העונש האולטימטיבי. נותנים לך כיסא, שולחן, נוף מהמם לקיר לבן. שבי תסתכלי כל היום על הקיר. צריך לשים ידיים על השולחן כל הזמן. אסור לשכל רגליים. אסור להסתכל לאחור. ישחררו אותך רק כשאת סותמת את הפה מספיק זמן. 
השגחת שירותים - לבנות שפגעו בעצמן. אמצעי לגיטימי כביכול. רק שאני לא פגעתי בעצמי אפילו פעם אחת במשך כל שנותי שם. ההשגחה הזו היתה למעשה עונש. מדריכה הייתה נכנסת איתי לשירותים ולמקלחת. כל המדריכות ידעו איך הגוף העירום שלי נראה, ובאיזו תנוחה אני יושבת בשירותים. בהתחלה שלי שם היתה מדריכה שהגדילה לעשות ולימדה אותי איך להתקלח - כמובן שאני לא מפגרת וידעתי איך. התביישתי לחשוף את גופי מולה, והיא היתה מקפידה שאני אשטוף את הכ-ס שלי מולה כל פעם. כל. פעם.
צרחות היו דבר בשגרה. צרחות, הכוונה. לא צעקות. מהדהדות בכל הבניין וגולשות עד לקצה השני של הרחוב.  
ועכשיו להדרן - מקרים אמיתיים שקרו לי בםנימיה שלא הגיוני שיקרו בכל מקום אחר בארץ!
לא רציתי לאכול פשטידה כי היא היתה מקולקלת (הרבה מהאוכל שם היה עם טעם רע(. המדריך הנחמד צרח עלי עד שהיו לי צלצולים באוזניים. ואחר כך, הוא נתן לי לאכול את כל התבנית. רציתי להקיא אבל הוא המשיך להכריח אותי לאכול. סיימתי את כולה בלילה ההוא. 
נקסט! אותה מדריכה שאהבה להכנס איתי למקלחת. יום אחד היא החליטה לתת לי לעלות ולרדת במדרגות, עונש נפוץ. אבל עם טוויסט! אתם מוזמנים לצחוק כי זה באמת מצחיק. כיסאות על הראש! כיסא ועוד אחד ועוד אחד. וככה עליתי וירדתי. נשבעת ביקר לי. אי אפשר להמציא דבר כזה.

האמת, כל השנה הראשונה שלי שם מטושטשת לי בטירוף. אני זוכרת ממש מעט משם. סליחה שאין לי עוד דוגמאות :<.
לא היה דין ולא היה דיין. מדריך היה יכול להגיע עצבני ולשבור לילד את היד (קרה פעמיים בשהותי שם) ולא יקרה לו כלום. הוא יכול להקים אותך, להושיב אותך, להוזיז אותך ממקום למקום. ואין לך שום ביי בנידון. כלום. 
זו הייתה חוויה שהשאירה בי צלקת לכל חיי. אני עד היום מנסה להרים את עצמי מההריסות שהמקום הזה השאיר בי."

But today, years later, after I did take the time and learn both Israel's and Palestine's history, I just can't explain an Israeli be pro Palestine on any level other than absolute naivity, ignorance of history, or due to suicidal tendencies

There wasn't ever a moderate faction that really accepted Israel existence and didn't see peace as a means to later destroy Israel

The Palestinians today (not Arabs in general, there are a ton of Arabs that identify as Israeli, they are our brothers and should be treated/regarded as such) are still mostly voting for parties who's members call for the destruction of Israel, be it in public, or behind closed doors

The most popular party among Palestinians in Gaza/West Bank is Hamas, who's charter calls for the death of all Jews (they don't bother with the anti Zionist BS, they literally say Jews)

This one obviously doesn't represent every single Palestinian but - they don't share any of our values, be it on democracy, women rights, LGBT rights, minority rights etc

I’m an orthodox convert. We just got back to my parents’ house after living in Israel. My parents’ very religious Christian neighbors left a wedding present for us, which my mom put in my childhood bedroom to open when I got back.

In the card, they wrote out Isaiah 53:3-5 and said, “We love you and are praying that you will find true love, peace and happiness in Jesus Christ in your marriage, in your lives and forever.” Their gift was a King James Bible.

These neighbors have known me for over 20 years (I’m 25.)

I’m debating whether I should respond in a thank you card with something like: “As someone who lives her life exactly like Jesus, I appreciate your dedication to your beliefs. Thank you for the translation of the Bible. If you ever want to read the original in Hebrew, I would be more than happy to direct you to some great resources. In the meantime, I’ve provided a Jewish explanation of the verse you included in your letter.” The explanation will likely be a photocopy of a page or two from Lets Get Biblical.

If confirmed Garland would’ve been the fourth Jew on that court (RBG + Breyer + Kagan + Garland), and I can’t help but feel as if that was just too many for the WASP political class.  

In a way, I even think that same kind of latent antisemitism at the highest levels of American politics is why Governor Pritzker isn’t running for president, and Dems are stuck with Biden again. 

Your thoughts?"

1,2023-07-16,"Help with understanding/clarification of Parashot Balak, Pinchas, and Matot",u/pwnering,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/151e3gx/help_with_understandingclarification_of_parashot/,"I am having a hard time connecting/understanding Parashot Balak, Pinchas, and Matot. These seem like rather difficult parashot and based on some of the commentaries I read, it seems like understanding Hebrew and the connotations associated with certain words make a big difference in the understanding of the Parashot, so I apologize in advance for the plethora of questions I have regarding these 3 Parashot.

In Parsha Balak, Balak tries to get the Israelites cursed through the prophet Balaam, he ends up blessing them instead. When Balak and Bilaam part ways, it fast forwards to the Israelites being immoral with the Midianite women, who then invite the Israelite men to worship their pagan god Baal-peor. HaShem tells Moshe to order the judges to kill everyone who was immoral with the Midianite women. Then we see a man who was caught with a Midianite (who we later find out is Zimri Ben Salu and Cozbi bat Zur). Pinchas kills them both. The “plague” then stops

Question 1) Why were they killed for sexual immorality and not Avodah Zara?

Question 2) Why was Pinchas praised for killing them both? I understand Zimri, but why Cozbi, did she know any better? Is there a Halacha that permits this (I think I read in a Chumash commentary that there is such a Halacha, but I don’t have a Chumash with me)

Question 3) Is the “plague” referring to the judges killing all the men who were being immoral as opposed to the modern definition that connotes a widespread sickness?

After learning of the identity of the 2 people Pinchas killed, HaShem tells Moshe to go to war with Midianite and says (according to the Sefaria translation) “ for they assailed you by the trickery they practiced against you —because of the affair of Peor, and because of the affair of their kinswoman Cozbi … who was killed at the time of the plague on account of Peor”

Question 4) What is the trickery being referred to, is it the sexual immorality or is it the Avodah Zara that followed/ “came” from the sexual immorality (commentaries seem to indicated that the sexual immorality enticed the Israelities to worship Baal Peor)?

Question 5) In my previous paragraph, I mention how HaShem ordered the death of all those who were sexual immoral, but here it says “the plague on account of Peor” which seems to indicate it was because of the Avodah Zara, so which one is it?

Later in Matot, the Israelite army fights the Midianites and kills all the men, they come back from battle and Moshe is angry because they spared the Midianite women “Yet, they are the very ones who, at the bidding of Balaam, induced the Israelites, to trespass against HaShem in the matter of Peor, so that HaShem’s community was struck by the plague. Now, therefore, slay every male among the noncombatants, and slay also every woman who has known a man carnally.”

Question 6) Where did Balaam tell the women to seduce the men?

Question 7) Why all the male non combatants, what did they have to do with it? Some commentaries say they men sent their wives and children to be immoral with the Israelite men, but from where are they making that assumption?

Question 8) I understand that the women are killed because of sexual immorality, but did they know what they were doing is wrong? I am under the impression that if you don’t know Halacha or what’s immoral/moral, you’re not liable if you do the wrong thing (ex. If you don’t know the laws of Kashrut, you aren’t liable for punishment since you didn’t know about them), does this not apply here? Does it change anything that the Midianites are Pagan? The Midianites knew of what HaShem did for the Israelites, but as far as I’m aware, the Midianites (including the Midianite women) didn’t know the laws HaShem gave to the Jewish people, so why are they liable?

Again I apologize for so many questions, but I would appreciate any and all insight, thanks everyone!"

 I like the flexibility and freedom that we get having a rental car. And I'd have to say... usually I find Israel to be one of the cheapest places to rent a car (anybody know why this is, by the way?) 

Anyway, even with the relatively cheap sticker price, I'm about to drop about $600 for two weeks. I'm just wondering out loud if there's an alternative, easy and convenient alternative that we maybe should consider? I'm thinking just maybe using a car share or even taking an uber when we need to might save us a chunk of change...

... or we'll just bite the bullet. Nothing like having the freedom of just being able to hop into the car and do what we want when we want while traveling.  Pro tips? "

This week is Parshas Devarim, the beginning of the book of Devarim. The accompanying Haftorah is Yeshayahu 1:1-1:27.

Our Parshah gives us Moses' recounting of the events that have thus far preceded for our nation in exile, as we made our way toward Eretz Yisrael. This is the first Parshah in Mishneh Torah, where it is said that rather than Moshe Rabbeinu directly conferring information to the nation from G-d, the information received and distributed was transmuted through his own machshovas. 

The accompanying Haftorah is a cautionary prophecy from Yeshayahu, and concludes with a promise that if we keep true to the Torah, we shall be blessed.

This Shabbat is one of our special Shabbats; it is the one called Shabbat Chazon. The Chazon (lit. ""Vision"") is said to be one of the Third Beit HaMikdosh to come. We are given an occasional glimpse, like a child whose father shows him a present, and promises to give that present if the child is well-behaved. 

We won't literally get to see it with our eyes, but chazal say that indeed, our neshamas will behold this vision. Through meditating on this idea throughout the week, and connecting with Torah, we can tune our radios in to what our neshamas will behold, and maybe some of that excitement can trickle down into our minds.

What do you think about Shabbat Chazon? About Deuteronomy as a whole? How will you engage with your study this week in preparation for your soul to be blessed?"

I've long struggled with my religion. My mother is Christian/Catholic and my father is Atheist, but neither of them have ever shown support for the possibility of me being part of a religion (except paganism for some reason because my grandma is convinced she's a ""witch""). My beliefs are that all religions are intertwined and have a bit of truth in each (they all have something in common with another) but they most closely fit into Judaism or Buddhism. Without going into much more detail I'll just end it with saying with that and the area I live in their isn't really anyone to talk to about it.

Jew is considered more ethnicity rather than religion ( for example  people whose father is Jewish would say they are Jewish in russia if they are asked about ethnicity even if by religion they arent) in post soviet countries.My question is that do you consider being jew yourself as religion or ethnicity?

[https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-750175](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-750175)

&#x200B;

* All four groups are strongly opposed to the Oslo Accords and any form of normalization with Israel. 
* They have also repeatedly called on the PA leadership to sever all relations with Israel.

&#x200B;

Instead of making peace with Israel, the PA is peddling to extremists. 

&#x200B;

It is almost certain that if a unity government forms, Hamas will take complete power. That’s the equivalent of the Taliban giving up their power, and joining with Afghanistan’s toppled government and professional experts. The last time the Palestinians had any attempt at a democratic election in Gaza was in 2006. It ended with Hamas entering the government building and shooting Fatah members in the their offices making Hamas the only party left in the Hamas-Fatah unity government."

And i dont know if this is the right place but i need to vent about this without getting hijacked by the anti-8th dayers so...

As a woman, this is brutal for me. Im still in constant physical pain, hormones from milk coming in, stressed about baby gaining weight, doing everything i can to encourage fast and copious milk coming in...and now...now...in the middle of typhoon Hormone, trying to help my other kids adjust, trying to figure out how we function as a newly sized family...the 8th day. 

Family coming in from 2 countries and 4 states. People in town for 4 days. I get easier if thats not the case but still. 

This feels like torture. Im so angry. Im not someone who would choose to delay but i cant help THINKING - and being angry - thst we obviously matter so little for this to be required of us 8 days after giving birth. 

I want this to be a time of kavanah and connection. But instead i just feel angry snd resentful that i couldnt be given st least a couple weeks so I could comfortably walk up stairs, let alone stand around greeting folks.

I know its d'oraita. I just wish i felt like i mattered."

1,2023-07-17,How can I get back into it?,u/theamazingsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/151nz7c/how_can_i_get_back_into_it/,"Disclaimer: I know that as I have Jewish ancestry rather than actually being Jewish there is a limited amount to which I can get ""back into"" it without actually converting, and I don't feel like I am in a place right now where I can confidently make that decision one way or another. I didn't know how else to phrase my question. Maybe getting back into a community will help me understand better. 

Anyway, my maternal grandfather was raised in a Jewish household until he ended up in a Catholic orphanage where the nuns baptized him and sent him thru catechism. 

I was raised by my maternal grandparents, and they raised my brother and I in a mix of Judaism and Catholicism, both because my grandfather had reconnected with his roots a bit and because the area we lived in was a pretty even split of the two. I can confidently say that 90% my positive holiday memories are of Jewish holidays, and in general I really favored the community and education I experienced in the more Jewish parts of my raising.

However, when my parents took my brother and I back my father decided that we were going to be evangelicals and that we had to leave behind all our Jewish friends, and that if my grandparents wanted to stay in our lives they had to do the same. From that point things got rough and I tried to get into evangelicalism the way I was into Judaism, but it never took. I am notoriously debate-driven, and was repeatedly told that I was ""looking for loopholes"" when I asked questions. Things in general were bad enough that I'm in my mid-20s and finally feel safe enough to seek out the community I was (partially) raised in and loved so much. But the thing is I have no idea how to reach out. I'm afraid to ask my grandparents, because I know it is painful for them to talk about, and while I know my grandfather's birth name and that he has a few sisters I've never met them. So, does anyone have any suggestions on how I can get back into the community and such? If I remember correctly I did some of the kid programs at the local JCC, would it be appropriate for me to reach out to them?

Hubby explained about seudah reviit and the bone that isn’t destroyed which didn’t seem to help. My eldest (who has an interest in forensic science) explained about the temperature and length of time needed to render a body to ash and theorized that the Germans didn’t take to time because the high numbers cremated wouldn’t allow it. That helped a bit, but they are still worried about the chance someone was cremated completely. 

Hubby is going to ask the Rabbi tomorrow morning, but I offered to ask here in case someone knows the answer sooner. They have anxiety and trouble sleeping and this is causing more problems with it. Therapist appointment is scheduled for later this month. 

BTW all of us loved the exhibit so if you get a chance to go we recommend it though it is difficult."

I am so bothered by how IP discussions occur online. They aren’t really discussions anymore. You have a IL bubble and a PA bubble. In the IL bubble you have people who say that all Palestinians should go back to Jordan and roll in the mud or something. In the PA bubble you have people calling all zionists terrorists and saying all Jews should die. How is this effective or progressive? Obviously twitter is a cesspool but clearly no one wants change. They just want to gripe and be angry, it seems. Am I just not being observant because I just noticed this?"

The person (ancestor) I need records on is https://www.geni.com/people/Rabbi-Pethahiah-Lida-A-B-D-%C5%81okacze/6000000019244851620 Rabbi Pethachia (spellings vary) Lida roughly 1671 birth to 1751 death. Dates are critical as other Rabbis may show up with similar names but obviously different years. The father is https://www.myheritage.com/names/david_lida also a Rabbi.

Specifically, I need the number of children and their names, and if possible the children's married names as well. Geni says 6 children but other sources vary that number. I would like to get the records for 6 if possible.

Copies of original source documents would be the most helpful, of course.

Records needed but behind paywalls:

https://www.myheritage.com/names/pethahiah_lida

https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/pethahiah-lida-24-1v4yv3d

I am interested in the records from the above links (if they have all 6 children listed and their married names/info), and any original sourced documents.

Specifically, this person https://www.geni.com/people/Hersz-Biderman-from-Miedzyrzec-Podlaski/6000000138610121825 is listed by Geni as a child of Rabbi Lida, and any additional info would be greatly appreciated (especially any documents, and info on why the name is so different from the siblings and does not have 'Lida' in it).  One possible clue is the Hebrew under the name in that Geni profile, which seems to spell out 'zisskind' or something similar.

This search has become very frustrating, so I would greatly appreciate any useful info you can provide."

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

What is the best way to help someone? If we want a society that helps individuals, what policies should be in place to help them? When considering the future, what vision of society should we strive for? What is good for  people?

Throughout history, philosophers have asked the question, ""what is the good life""? What kind of goal should we set for ourselves in order to live the best life?

In today's terms, we might rephrase this question in relation to computers. How can we distill our vision of a good life into a few words that encapsulate the direction our civilization should take? If we had an all-powerful computer, what goal should we program it to pursue?

One could argue that the best way to help an individual is to bring them happiness. Our objective should be to maximize happiness for as many people as possible.

However, achieving happiness may be deceptively easier than it appears. It might be feasible to compel everyone to take a drug that induces blissful happiness, even if they are confined to a small room and provided with only the minimum nutritional requirements to sustain their lives. Surely, this is not what we mean by helping people attain the good life.

The problem is that, after centuries of contemplation, philosophers have yet to find a single compelling answer to this question. Science can aid in implementing whichever answer we ultimately arrive at, but it cannot determine the fundamental goals we should initially set.

Perhaps we should simply ask people what they want. Maybe the highest value is the freedom for individuals to choose their own goals. Yet, the issue arises that most people may provide bad answers, since they may not truly know what they want.

The most extreme example is an addict who may simply desire more of whatever it is that they are addicted to. However, one could argue that even addicts often wish to overcome their addiction.

The darkest regimes in the world are governed by a small group of individuals who believe that their own people cannot be trusted to know what is in their best interest. Yet, even the most enlightened societies often contain a minority of rich, powerful, or highly educated individuals who believe that the general population cannot be trusted to understand their true needs.

If we do not believe that we can definitively prove which way of life is superior, it seems that the only way to move forward is to provide everyone with the means to choose their own value system. In this scenario, the role of society would be to ensure access to the truth, offer top-quality education, foster mental well-being, and provide available technology that assists individuals in making their best decisions.

Perhaps the ultimate goal is to maximize the freedom to choose - ""the greatest freedom for the greatest number of people."" This freedom must include the ability to choose a lifestyle that others might consider restrictive.

Individuals in positions of power often argue that society has no right to interfere with or limit their freedom, but they overlook the fact that maximizing their own freedom can sometimes result in less freedom for others. The best way to help others is to grant them more freedom. The objective should be equality of freedom rather than the equal distribution of any other physical resource. To achieve this, power, opportunities, and the tools to make rational decisions must be as widely distributed as possible.

Returning to the question of programming an all-powerful computer, the answer would be as follows: Every decision made on behalf of an individual should align with what they would consent to with access to sufficient truth and unbiased education.o truth and unbiased education."

I'm an Indian businessman with a few ties to the local Jewish community and I wish to build stronger relationships with them in the future. 

I've worked closely with Jewish clients and Jewish colleagues from London over the last decade. 

I've come across this phrase often - ""Anti-zionist is Anti-semitic"" (Most recently in Lex's podcast with PM Netanyahu) I don't see anything wrong with this statement. Anyone wishing the destruction of an independent Jewish state or rather wishing such a state didn't exist is subconsciously/consciously propagating anti-Semitic ideas. 

However, my own left leaning Jewish friends seem to have a problem with this statement. Goes without saying that most left leaning people in my country are by default Anti-zionist. 

What am I missing here ? 

Which books, articles can I read to both support and challenge my views ?

How does the sub feel about such a statement? 

Finally, most media houses are constantly sharing negative news about Israel and I'm sick of that hypocrisy. Are there other sources of news that I can subscribe to, that presents facts as they are ?

1,2023-07-17,Considering joining an Orthodox Shul as a modern young woman with a complicated relationship to Judaism… it possible?,u/fried_pink_potatoes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/151v4hc/considering_joining_an_orthodox_shul_as_a_modern/,"I want to apologize in advance if this is confusing or rambling and way too long at all… right now there are a lot of thoughts and emotions floating around and I feel very lost. I would genuinely appreciate any respectful opinions or advice. 

I feel like I have a Jewish soul. My earliest and happiest childhood memories are of celebrating Hanukkah and Passover with my friends and family. We were all Reform and very casual about our Judaism, we never went to synagogue but we kept Kosher and celebrated major holidays. My dad taught me Jewish history and the stories of how our family came to America after escaping persecution in Poland. I was very confidently Jewish and Mexican because I engaged in the traditions of my parents. All was well, and I felt secure in the two rich cultures I was lucky to be a part of. 

When I turned 9 I told my parents I wanted to become a Bat Mitzvah so they enrolled me in classes at our Temple. That was the first time I realized there was something wrong with my Judaism. I was informed by another student that I was not a real Jew because my mother is Mexican and it made me feel awful. I almost quit after that day because I felt like I didn’t belong, but after speaking to the wonderful Rabbi Allen Bennett (The first Openly Gay Rabbi in America!! Amazing guy!) I felt bolstered to keep trying. I began to go to Shul every single week and eventually integrated myself in the community and it was WONDERFUL. I learned about ALL the holidays and observed Shabbat and felt so, so happily Jewish. My Bat Mitzvah ceremony was one of the most beautiful and fulfilling experiences of my life. 

Soon after that, my life took a dark turn and my Judaism shattered. My mother’s physical and mental abuse heightened to severe levels, and the ensuing chaos threw my soul into chaos. I don’t want to get too much into it, but the relevant part is that she became incredibly antisemitic. I was an abused child and was manipulated into not just renouncing my Judaism, but actively hating and looking down upon it. And my Jewish family. I was in a survival state but the pain tore my spirit apart more than I can articulate, and the guilt I feel eats me alive. 

It’s been about 10 years since then. I’ve finally broken free from my mother’s abuse and am trying to recover my life. But… during some of my hardest moments I’ve drawn strength from my Jewish ancestors. I thought about all the genocide and pogroms and inquisitions and holocausts they’ve survived. They made it through the most unbearable circumstances, refusing to completely give up their faith even when faced with torture and suffering and death. Sometimes they had to hide it to survive… but the flame never went out. For thousands of years they clung to their culture with the hope that their descendants would be free, peaceful Jews. They succeeded, and I am the proof. WE are the living proof that their greatest dreams in their darkest hours came true. 

As I battle depression and ptsd and despair in my journey to reclaim my life, I find myself craving the comfort of Judaism and its wisdom. I want to learn more about the philosophies that kept our wandering people strong and alive for thousands of years. I’m in Therapy with a secular therapist but… I want to reconnect with my Judaism as well. I don’t know if I deserve Judaism, or if I’m even a real Jew because of my mother…. But if there’s any chance of redemption I want it so badly. 

In a week I’m moving across the country and I think once I get settled in I want to start going to temple again. Every week, like I used to. I want to celebrate the peace of Shabbat and involve myself in the community and study Torah adopt all the customs that my ancestors preserved for me. But… the closest temple to me is Orthodox and I’m feeling conflicted. 

I have the greatest respect for Orthodox Jews. Whenever I see one in public I feel a wave of awe wash over me. I genuinely think they’re so, so cool. I have always wanted to be friends with Orthodox Jews or get to know them. I’ve wanted to experience Shabbat at their homes and attend their services without feeling totally lost. I just want to learn and immerse myself deep into traditional Jewish culture. 

But like I mentioned… I’m not halachically Jewish. Plus… not only am I half Mexican, but I’m bisexual and Polyamorous. I have multiple partners that I love deeply, and I wouldn’t want to “get rid” of any of them. Of course I would be modest at temple, but I’m very sexually promiscuous in my personal life. And to be honest… I am not sure how much I believe in G-d anymore, rather, I believe in the spirit of the Jewish people and our beliefs. There’s also the fact that I’m disconnected from Judaism, and what I *do* know I learned from Reform temple, which isn’t as traditional as Orthodox. I’m really scared that I won’t belong or be accepted. I’m worried that if I go they’ll be polite, but secretly look down upon me and want me gone. 

I know I *could* find a reform temple on the other side of town to go to and that probably be easier… but I really want to immerse myself in observant Jewish culture. The kind my family experienced. My great-grandfather founded an Orthodox synagogue and began a Jewish community that is still going strong to this day. Judaism is important to my blood and it’s important to me… but I feel so confused. Am I too “beginner” to join an Orthodox community? Am I too far from redemption as a Jew? Am I even a real Jew? Do I even deserve to try to reconnect after my past? Is the Orthodox lifestyle something I cannot aspire to since I was not raised in it? 

I would genuinely appreciate any thoughts or opinions you guys have. Just please be kind, even if you think I’m an idiot. Thank you <3"

I am not a Jew, so I hope some of you could satiate my curiousity about a figure that (at least in mainstream variants) in all Abrahamic religions, except in Judaism, is a malevolent figure, an originator of evil - an angel that rebelled against G-d (I'm not a Jew, but I'll write it this way) and thus subjected all other creatures to his cruelty and malice. Both Islam and Christianity believe in him as the enemy of humankind and all creatures.


In Judaism, however (correct me if I'm wrong) Satan refers to two things: 

1. Simply an agent given to role of *an* enemy.

2. The angel who is there to tempt humanity and work against it, especially to be the accuser of Israel. This angel actually does follow G-d and simply does his job, it's just that we humans don't really like him or his job...


So this makes Judaism a bit different from other Abrahamic religions. And yet, I am fairly certain that there were sects/denominations of Judaism that believed in the same thing Islam and Christianity do about the Devil and the fallen angels - after all, these beliefs probably didn't come out of nowhere in Christianity (hence, the Book of Enoch).


So are there any denominations/movements of Judaism that believe the same thing about fallen angels as Christians and Muslims do? Or has this completely disappeared and instead become an integral part of its offshoot (Christianity)?


Thank you in advance and please sorry if I have made any mistakes!"

What are the job prospects for someone with \~2.5 years experience within (more technical) data analyst roles, coming to Israel? Not data engineering but more on the side of data science.

Would it be difficult to find work, how would you suggest approaching finding employment?

1,2023-07-17,"In a very tough situation, any advice would be greatly appreciated!",u/KingFonny97,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1523zf9/in_a_very_tough_situation_any_advice_would_be/,"I (25M) have been with a 24FM for closing in on 5 years now. When we had first met and clearly had interest in each other, we had discussed what we'd wanted. At that time, we were both in complete agreement that we were looking for nothing serious and just were looking to go with the flow/have fun for the time being. Fast forward 4.5 years, we have become very close if not best friends. We have a lot of core things in common, hang out pretty much every weekend and have even travelled together (and had a blast!) 

I'd say going back about a year (maybe 2) now, I've noticed a bit of a lull in our communications via text. The texts went from energetic and always very excited to hang to somewhat dull and dry texts. I mentioned it a couple times throughout (when I really noticed it) but the few times that I did mention it she said ""she was having a bad week and it was nothing against me"" or things along those lines. I would believe her and usually things would start to pick up (energy wise) a bit in the texts again but then within a couple weeks would start to notice them going dry once again.

I've questioned over these last couple years (more so lately) if this was happening due to A) her wanting more and not saying anything? B) Her just becoming (more) comfortable in the situation and us not really being in the ""lovey dovey"" stage of those first couple years anymore? C) Other

Here's where things get even more complicated..

When I first met this girl, one of the first things I asked her was about her background/religion/upbringing. She had explained to me that she was raised Jewish (had a bat mitzvah, observed all holidays with her family etc.) but when diving deeper into it she slipped in that although she was raised Jewish and considers herself Jewish (also plans to raise a Jewish family) it was her dad that was Jewish but not her mom. In my head this has really complicated things.

Long story short because this can on for days, yesterday I finally decided (& had the courage) to address everything with her just in terms of where were at/see things going forward. (Before anyone says this should have been addressed a long time ago, I am aware of that and believe because we've both been so content with the situation, it just was never brought up by either of us in a long time.) When I brought it up, I can see that it totally caught her off guard. The first thing we talked about was the communication thing that I've been feeling and her response was that ""this was nothing she was doing consciously and had she known it was bothering me this much she would have made extra effort to address it."" I then followed that with ""so.. where do you see us going forward?"" and her response was ""well, to be honest, I've just been so happy/content with what we've had until this point, that I never really put too much thought in to that tbh."" I know for most people reading this that would probably be very hard to believe (that someone wouldn't even think about that once in a 4.5 year ""relationship"") but for me personally.. I believe her since I kind of feel/have felt the same way.

I come from a Jewish (modern orthodox) household (parents religious but I/rest of family are not) and my question for all of you here is, was I just subconsciously not even allowing myself the possibility of dating her over the last 4.5 years due to her ""technically"" not being Jewish? The convo yesterday ended with both of us being pretty emotional and her telling me that me putting her in the moment and forcing her to really assess how she feels made her discover/realize that she does indeed have feelings for me (and I believe the feelings are mutual based off how I felt during the convo/after as well.) I briefly mentioned the ""Jewish factor"" once again to her and she was very confused saying ""what do you mean.. I am Jewish.. how could you tell me I'm not?"" which led me to veer away from that part of the conversation.

When I dive deep into my own values, it's always been very important for me to marry Jewish (& raise a Jewish family) but even more so, the #1 thing I've always wanted in my life is to make my parents proud. I guess where things get/are complicated in my head is that because she was raised Jewish/considers herself Jewish and plans to raise a Jewish family, all those things would be enough for me personally, but I don't believe it would be enough for my parents. If she was a full and through goy, it would make things a lot easier in my head (to cut off.)

I plan to talk with my parents tonight and just reveal all of this to them/see where there at (although I have a pretty solid idea of what they're going to say) - one thing to note is I have kept this under wraps (again, perhaps subconsciously because I knew how my parents would react if I told them) so this will all be new/very surprising to them which scares me as well.

I guess to conclude here.. clearly I have some type of feelings for this girl (and vice versa) and we have some sort of special connection to have made things work for this long (with little to no arguments/issues throughout.) I really enjoy spending time with her (again, would probably consider her my best friend now) but I cannot say with confidence that I ""love"" her because like I mentioned, I believe subconsciously I just never allowed myself due to the situation. I believe in my heart that I would love to give her a chance (& believe we can be compatible long term) but the fear of being cut off and/or disappointing my parents is very real and I believe is holding me back.

I know (from speaking with people about this already) that everyone says at the end of the day I should do what's gonna make me\* happy long term, but i really don't know if following my heart for this girl and potentially losing my parents (or at the very least their respect/support) is worth it? And yes, my parents have been adamant that marrying Jewish is #1 priority, so I would either be cut off or live the rest of my life knowing I disappointed them beyond words.

Any advice/insight or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated and I thank ya'll in advance!

1,2023-07-17,A thought experiment--Jordan within a proposed confederation solution.,u/Matar_Kubileya,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1524ebg/a_thought_experimentjordan_within_a_proposed/,"I will begin this post with a disclaimer: the model of solution I am going to suggest is not one I am advocating. Nor is it one I necessarily disagree with. Rather, I believe that in the present day it is not remotely feasible for a multitude of reasons. I present it merely as a counterfactual, an attempt to understand the politics of the real by constructing the politics of the un-real. 

What I am imagining, then, should be fairly straightforward from the title: a confederation solution, as is often proposed, but as is almost never discussed including the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan within said solution. There are, at least *prima facie*, several reasons why this might be a good idea: on the one hand, Jordan is home to the largest Palestinian population outside of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, on the other, while not exactly the world's most amicable relationship, the Israeli-Jordanian peace agreement is Israel's second longest lasting with any Arab nation, and given Jordan's dependence on Israeli desalination there is more integration between the two countries than Israel and any Arab neighbor bar Palestine to boot. Between these factors and geographic proximity, the HKJ represents the natural candidate for inclusion of a third nation in any confederation, at least within the bounds of speculation.

What I propose, for the sake of this thought experiment, would be something roughly akin to the European Union in terms of depth of integration, albeit with different responsibilities and capacities assigned to the confederal government. This confederal authority would provide an oversight body and human rights commission to monitor the general actions of each member's government, but its actual power would potentially be limited to managing joint economic policy including water rights and distribution (a subject which will only be of increased importance in the coming years). Each country would generally provide the right of residency to citizens of all member nations, subject to security oversight, but granting citizenship and with it the right to vote (at least in national elections) would remain at the discretion of each member state. A token joint protective force with responsibility for sites of trilateral concern--governmental and diplomatic as well as religious sites--would exist, but otherwise each state would maintain its own security forces, though there would be an obligation to collective defense. Add further interpretations or deviate from mine if you will, but this is my suggestion for the sake of this thought experiment.

So my question for discussion is very general--how do you think this would go, particularly with regard to the slightly-more-likely alternative of a confederal solution involving only Israel and Palestine? Relative to the status quo? Relative to any other solution?"

A little nervous to post this - please go easy on me. My best friend is from Haifa and she's getting married in Israel this September.

I've heard some stories, and I'm not sure what to believe, but I'm a little nervous about .... delays getting into the country. 

I lived in Lebanon and interned for UNRWA  The (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East) for about six months in 2018. I have a new passport (because I lost my old one lol), so no Lebanese stamp, but my work history is my work history. I currently work for another humanitarian organization that doesn't operate in the territories, but wondering if I'll have any ... issues upon arrival. I want to plan my travel so that I make it to the wedding. I heard from a former UNRWA colleague that they were detained for quite some time based on their affiliation with the organization, so I'm just trying to gauge if there will be any delays. 

I'm hoping to keep the discussion civil and on topic. Perhaps I'm overthinking it, but I want to triple check and ensure that I allow enough time for getting to the wedding. Thanks in advance. Looking forward to seeing what is supposedly a beautiful country. "

I don’t pay attention to the people who say “I love Israel and my people but I never would want to live in a country that’s mostly Jewish”. This kind of self hating garbage goes in one ear and out the other for me. Regarding the political situation…I’ll just say it’s a little odd to point this out as a reason to avoid Israel, considering we live in the USA with the current circus and I’ll just leave it at that.

I’d like to hear what are the big downsides of living in the country, both from sabras and olim. As a frame of reference I moved to New York City as a penniless 20 year old, put myself through college, and lived there for 12 years before deciding to try something different and move to Austin (Texas), so it’s not like I’ve never dealt with high cost of living, high competition, high stress, high bureaucracy, cutthroat landlords and business owners, everything being a hassle (including buying pencils or grocery shopping), standstill traffic, congested public transit, and even language barriers all over the place. To be fair I have never been an immigrant in another country, although my wife has and also made it work in New York."

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

There are moments in our lives that have a significant impact on our future and the lives of others. On the other hand, there are also long stretches of time where no specific moment is particularly significant.

Moments of power are those tiny instances of time when we exercise our power to make an impact. The defining features of these moments are that they are irrevocable, very short and have significant consequences.

We can also express our power by avoiding such moments. For example, every second we spend driving a car could potentially lead to a terrible moment with serious consequences. By driving safely and without incidents, we are exercising our power to avoid these negative moments. Similarly, while interacting with others, we may not create much impact in individual seconds, but a single instance of insult could have an irrevocable effect. Thus, moments of power can be seen as existing in both positive and negative states, based on what we do or choose not to do.

Some moments of power involve verbal communication, while others are action-oriented. While words can be interpreted and may not be entirely irrevocable, actions like pressing a button or destroying something have a more final impact.

Making a purchase, signing a contract, or giving an order are moments when we exercise the power entrusted to us by society.

Society often concentrates power in extreme ways. Some individuals have the power to significantly impact the lives of many others, while others may have much less power. For example, a judge has the power to decide a punishment, or a legislator has the authority to write new laws. These deliberations may take a long time, but the specific moment when a ruling is made, or a deciding vote is cast, is a moment of power.

Once a law is enacted, that moment of power becomes a lasting legal statement. However, since this moment of power is primarily verbal, the effect of these words depends on their interpretation. Later on, the question may arise as to whether the words should be interpreted independently of the context or whether the intention of the legislators at the time the law was enacted should be taken into account.

Moments of power bring about both stability and instability. While a moment of power causes a sudden change, the periods between these moments are less likely to change continuously. This allows others to plan and make decisions within a relatively stable context. If changes occurred continuously, decision-making would be impossible as the ground would constantly be shifting. In this sense, everyone else needs change to concentrate into specific moments, leaving other times more stable.

However, the fact that many changes that impact our lives happen in a single moment leaves us vulnerable to the dangers created by the impulsive nature of that moment. While we hope that moments of power are the result of careful deliberation, this is not always the case. This instability is the consequence of these moments of power.

When a decision is made based on thoughtful consideration over time, more processing power has been involved in the decision-making process. If a person is able to compute only so much reasoning, in, say, a minute, then hours or days of deliberation might represent the accumulated reasoning of all that time.

Similarly, when power is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals who make decisions that affect a large population, there is less processing power applied to the decision. This danger posed by the fact that less processing has been devoted to a critical decision, is compounded by the fact that concentrated power does not allow for diverse viewpoints and the deliberative process that contribute to making better decisions."

&#x200B;

After watching (מחול) now for a while the turmoil that has overtaken our country as a result of Bibi's attempted coup, I have come to a realisation that I'd like to share for discussion and critique: As in the paradox of tolerance, it is violence that must be applied to the intolerant, to maintain tolerance, so in Israel, must our least Democratic elements be employed to defend our democracy. To clarify, I am not advocating violence, but simply appreciating the already occurring meritocracy that undermines the protests and general strikes.

&#x200B;

Listening to a podcast (אחד ביום) recently that interview right wing Israelis I was privy to the sentiment that right wing voters feel like they have become second class citizens. This rhetoric seems to have been directly generated by Bibi himself, but it makes sense considering the facts: The right won the election, formed a government, and then when trying to enact reforms met massive resistance. The feeling they expressed was that their vote doesn't count for anything. This is, obviously, a failure of a democratic system to respect the individual rights of every citizen, however this is only a surface level understanding of the situation. A modern democracy is also supposed to respect the rights of individuals from the oppression of the masses. This is the facet that the Judicial Reform would ultimately damage, at least at first (before it goes on to destroy the country entirely).

&#x200B;

The protestors understand this, and are actively resisting it. What's interesting however in my opinion, is not so much the number of protestors, but their demographics. Bibi has tried to use this as a political tool, decrying them as liberal ashkenazi elites, but functionally, they make up the majority of the countries productive members. Israel is not like America, or any other country, in that we are distinctly less established and as a result distinctly more dependant on our major drivers of growth and stability, specifically the HiTech industry and the IDF (No HiTech isn't Israel's only industry, but it has been Israel's only predominantly succesful one over the past for years). It is becoming apparent that the immediate value of Democracy isn't as apparent to all citizens equally, and that some don't value it as much as maybe they should. Fortunately (in my opinion), there is an overlap between these values, and productive members of society. The ones that contribute to the country's GDP, global status, tax revenue, and defence. This can be seen in the general strike of air force reservists and the agreement between the unions and corporations to allow paid strike days. The people with influence (an inately undemocratic concept) are standing up.

&#x200B;

Ultimately, Bibi's supporters are still hold a numerical majority in the country. The protestors represent a minority of the population as individuals, but meritocratically they outweigh the majority. As a supporter of democracy myself this upsets me, but I see practically that it is working to the country's benefit. The Haredi voters that put Bibi in power contribute nothing to the country's wealth or defence (unless you believe in their prayers, but at this point we're all praying are we not?), and in a country such as ours, who's future hangs precariously in the balance, this means more than it normally would. It is this system, heavily weighted in favour of merit, rather than individual value, that underlies the strikes, and might potentially save Israel's institutions of democracy.

&#x200B;

Obviously this will upset some people, but I'm posting it here for discussion, because you can't form valid opinions in a bubble, and I recognise both the positive and negative effects living overseas right now has on my ability to see the situation clearly. All criticism more than welcome.

However, OP posts her question due to her strong desire to better understand HaShem’s words.

We learned both King Saul and King Uzziah made the mistake of crossing the royal-priest boundary. They suffered so greatly for the indiscretion.

However, 1 Kings 9:25 says the following: Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and sacrifices of well-being on the altar that he built for the LORD, offering incense before the LORD.

What was the difference in the way they crossed the royal-priest boundary? (Solomon vs. Saul/Uzziah)

I seek to gain a better understanding on this so that I can do what is right in the eyes of Hashem throughout my life."

Groups like Queers for Palestine in particular are especially derided because they are ""for"" a country that [systematically oppresses gay people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_State_of_Palestine)

In response to these criticisms, the groups in question come back by claiming they aren't actually pro-Palestine, not really. They just want to solve the problem, i.e. end the conflict. Usually they phrase this as ""I want the Palestinian people not to be occupied any more,"" or ""I just want the occupation to end"" or ""I just want the Palestinians to be free in their own state."" Seems pretty innocuous, right? Who wouldn't want the Palestinians to be free in their own state? Such sentiments are not controversial, at least when the group is anyone other than Jews, it seems.

But pro-Palestinian activists' subsequent actions in service of this alleged goal of solving the problem don't actually serve that goal. Rather than be part of the solution, pro-Palestinians routinely and regularly insist on being part of the problem. The attitude of the pro-Palestinian movement, as far as I can tell, is not ""how can we convince the two sides to stop fighting?"" or ""how can we resolve these decades long disputes and animosities?"" It's far more often viewpoints such as ""the Palestinians should hate Israelis, because Israelis deserve to be hated. If Palestinians don't hate Israelis now, they should start, and if they already do, they should hate the Israelis more"", ""Israel is a genocidal apartheid state and has no right to exist"" and [""have you punched a Zionist today?""](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/punch-a-zionist-mcgill-student-politics-1.3975773)

Put another way, how does any of these actions actually help solve the problem:

* Harassing ""Zionists"" on college campuses
* Disrupting Holocaust memorials
* Attacking Holocaust survivors
* Spreading hatred of ""Zionists""
* Spreading and justifying anti-Zionism
* Telling lies about Israelis
* Justifying Palestinian terrorism
* Underplaying Hamas rocket attacks as ""harmless firecrackers"" and rock throwing as ""peaceful protest""
* Spreading anti-Semitism (yes, some of these groups indisputably do that, feel free to ask for examples)

You can also see this with prominent ""pro-Palestinian"" politicians like Prima Jayapal who made the news this week for attacking Israel's very existence and then being forced to walk it back. Her, Tlaib, AOC, Omar, have they done literally anything towards bringing the two sides together in mutual understanding? Like anything at all? As far as I can tell, all they do is talk shit on Twitter for attention.

Something you'll always see with pro-Palestinians, and really people in general, is that their actions speak louder than words, and their actions don't match their proclaimed motivations. They say all they want to do is solve the problem, yet they make the problem worse every day. Being anti-Zionist and supportive of Palestinian terrorism doesn't help the two sides make peace, but it's taken as gospel among pro-Palestinians that Israelis have no right to live in their own homeland. It's reached the point where if you don't actively want Israel to no longer exist, and are prepared to act on that desire, you're not welcome in any part of the 'pro-Palestinian' movement.

So pro-Palestinians: why are you insisting on being part of the problem when you could be part of the solution?"

I already have a potential girl name to honor my grandmother, but I am very much struggling with boy names for my grandfathers.

I don't know yet if I'll be having a boy or a girl, so we're trying to come up with as many potential names as possible, and then choosing the right one once we meet the baby. 

But anyway, I have some questions about naming practices that I haven't been able to find online. (And we can't really ask our families because we haven't announced the pregnancy yet).

1. I was always under the assumption that the general practice was to choose a name with the same first letter to honor someone who has passed. But then I remembered that I am named after someone with a name that rhymes with mine, but has a different first letter. (Think something like Bella and Stella). Is there a rule about this?
2. Can I name a girl baby after my grandfather? Both my grandfather's names start with letters that unfortunately don't have many other male names that appeal to me at all. For example, one of them starts with S, and I can't find any male S names that I like (other than his exact name which obviously I'm not supposed to use) but there are plenty of female S names that I LOVE. 
3. Are there any rules or general advice in regards to the order in which I honor my grandparents? Do I start in the order they passed away? (Meaning, should my first child ideally be named after my grandparent who has been gone the longest?)

Also, how do I go about choosing their Hebrew names? My husband and I currently live in an area with no synagogue so I have no rabbi to go to for advice. We do plan to move in the next few years however. "

Like [Matt Walsh's ""What is a woman?""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbvq7Jpvcas) I find straight answers and widespread agreement on ""What does Islam have to do with the Israel-Palestine conflict?"" frustratingly elusive. It's not nothing. This conflict cannot be correctly conceptualized and understood without any reference to Islam. But at the same time, it's not everything. Learning a lot about Islam is not, in and of itself, sufficient to understanding everything there is to know about Team Palestine.

What I have noticed, is that asking this question tends to inspire obfuscation. Downplay or sidestep any role played by Islam, and I'll quickly be told I'm wrong, and am blissfully ignorant to the cultural background of this conflict, and what motivates people in this part of the world. Play up any role played by Islam, and I'll also quickly be told I'm wrong (and bigoted), and be treated to a parade of examples of pro-Palestinian people and actions that have no connection to Islam at all. Sometimes I'll also be presented with a list of historical conflicts elsewhere in the world involving a majority-Muslim tribe against a non-Muslim tribe, which went nothing like the Palestinian resistance. I often get the feeling that advocates for Team Palestine do not appreciate me asking this question, and do their best, in the way they respond, to discourage me pushing the issue or asking again. I've even received responses with a tone clearly aimed at making me feel bad or look bad for having asked in the first place. The message is clear: ""Let's not go there.""

Well, I'm going there.

My conclusion is that Islam definitely *has* played, and still plays, *some* meaningful role in the initiation and perpetuation of Palestinian resistance. But there is either little agreement on exactly what that role was and is, or much perceived benefit in this role *not* being precisely articulated and widely known, and remaining ""up for debate"".

Ideally, I think the relationship between the Muslim faith and the Palestinian resistance to Israel should be expressible in one concise sentence, or at the most a short paragraph, on what properties of Islamic doctrine, practice, and history make people who self-identify as Muslims highly likely to steadfastly support and sympathize with Team Palestine. The best possible answer, I think, would also make it clear, by corollary, why many supporters and sympathizers of Team Palestine are not Muslim, and on the other hand, why many Muslims are't (and wouldn't be) supporters and sympathizers of Team Palestine.

I'm not a mathematician by any stretch of the imagination, but I compare this logical exercise to the finding an unknown mathematical function. For example, if we know that 1@4=7, 3@9=15, and 7@10=23, then what is X@Y, expressed in basic algebraic functions? In other words, what transformation does ""@"" involve?"

I was wondering if anyone knew of any resources that expands on this?   


1. **Biblical Period (1200 BCE – 500 BCE)**: This period, also known as the period of the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible), is marked by the early development of Jewish monotheistic thought, as reflected in the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings. The biblical period includes the Exodus, the time of the Judges, the United Monarchy under Saul, David, and Solomon, and the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah.
2. **Second Temple Period (516 BCE – 70 CE)**: The Second Temple period begins with the construction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem and includes the time of the Babylonian Exile, the return of the Jews under Cyrus the Great, and the development of various Jewish sects, such as the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes. This period also saw the influence of Hellenistic philosophy, which eventually led to the works of Philo of Alexandria.
3. **Rabbinic Period (70 CE – 500 CE)**: Also known as the period of the Talmud, this era saw the codification of Jewish oral law into the Mishnah and the Gemara, forming the Talmud. The consolidation of Rabbinic Judaism, which emphasized study and adherence to the Torah and the teachings of the rabbis, was a key development during this period.
4. **Medieval Period (500 CE – 1750 CE)**: During the Middle Ages, Jewish thought was significantly influenced by the surrounding Christian and Muslim cultures. This period produced many major Jewish philosophers such as Saadia Gaon, Maimonides, and Judah Halevi. Kabbalah, Jewish mystical thought, also developed during this period, with the publication of foundational texts like the Zohar.
5. **Modern Period (1750 CE – Present)**: This period saw considerable changes due to the Enlightenment and the emergence of new movements such as Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism, and Orthodox Judaism. Jewish thought in this era grappled with issues such as secularism, modernism, the role of tradition, and the emergence of Zionism. Key Jewish thinkers during this period include Moses Mendelssohn, Abraham Geiger, Samson Raphael Hirsch, and Mordecai Kaplan.

It's like in their mind they're constantly victimized by our mere existence and they accuse us of weird stuff like being educated in school that Polish people were responsible for the Holocaust instead of Germans - which they then use to justify their hatred for Israel and sometimes Jews. Meanwhile there's zero criticism of their government outlawing research on their role in the Holocaust and pogroms. It seems absurd.

So why do you think this is?"

What I like about this question is that everyone can have a different event that they can point to as a crucial turning point in a certain history.

Obviously, a historical event does not come out of a vacuum. For example, many people believe that the Civil War was a turning point in American racial relations history, while others believe that the Civil Rights movement was a much more crucial event. It would be difficult to discuss the importance of the Civil Rights movement without mentioning the Civil War; some people just choose to believe that one event is a much more defining moment than the other. Neither is wrong, its just a conviction that they personally have about historical events.

For Israel-Palestine, would you consider the ""Second Intifada"" to be a very crucial event in the history, or the assassination of Rabin, or the Yom Kippur war, etc. 

Remember, there are no right or wrong answers. Just how you personally view the history of the conflict."

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

Most people are familiar with the myth of the Genie who will grant you three wishes. Behind this narrative trick lies a deep and important idea - figuring out what we truly want is more difficult than it seems at first. This question becomes even more crucial when we consider how to structure a society that can confidently navigate a future full of radical change.

We face a dilemma - even if we could grant everyone on Earth their wishes, many people struggle to articulate what they truly desire. So, perhaps the best guiding question to help people think about and express their wants is, ""where would you like to be in five years' time?""

After pondering this question, many people might answer that they want to be wealthier, in good health, living an interesting and fulfilling life, surrounded by loved ones, and appreciated by those around them.

Once we receive an answer, we can start working on the immediate action items that are most likely to bring about the desired outcome. Naturally, we assume that the solutions have been discussed with the person being questioned and that we have their consent for each step.

But how would a person addicted to some substance or behavior answer this question? There is no offer here to supply more of the immediate gratification they seek. The question simply provides a framework for setting policies that can help achieve the ultimate goal. For many people struggling with harmful short-term needs, their answer might be that they hope to see themselves free from their addiction in five years' time. Perhaps we need to ask this question repeatedly over a month and average out the answers given.

Many people will not only answer where they want to be in five years, but will also express strong opinions about the future status of those around them, their nation, their culture, or humanity as a whole. They will also express their hopes to see progress in their current life missions in terms of society, sports, culture, technology, ecology, or entertainment.

There are roughly three possible alternatives to consider:

The first alternative is that only a select few get to answer the question of where they want to be in five years and the rest of the world is manipulated, brainwashed, or lied to in order to advance the personal goals of these powerful individuals.

The second alternative is that a small group of people who claim to know better than everyone else, get to decide what is best for everybody. However, this solution is problematic because there are so many different views proposed by ""experts"" that it becomes impossible to determine the right one. There is a very low probability of selecting the true view. Furthermore, when a small group of people have the power to decide, corruption often makes this alternative evolve into the first one.

The third alternative is a world where every individual is empowered to make progress in their own chosen direction. Of course, each person's desired outcomes will inevitably conflict with others', and society will have to find ways to resolve these contradictions guided by principles of equality, realism, and fairness.

It appears that we are already on the path of the first alternative. So, which of these alternative paths should we be on, and what actions should we take today if we want our preferred alternative to prevail?"

He went on a rant about why are ""the Jews"" getting involved in wars that don't concern them (hypocritical from any European, and also hypocritical given that this friend has never stepped foot in Morocco). The conversation evolved into discussing the conflict.

His two main concerns about Israel were:

* The walls
* Israel selling weapons

This made me reflect a lot about the double standard the world seems to have for Israel.

Every country gets involved in affairs and conflicts abroad... Hell, most countries in the world have a strong say about the Israeli Palestinian conflict, including Spain.

About 77 countries have border walls, including Spain, and another dozen or so are in the making as we speak.

Many many countries sell weapons, including Spain.

Why is it that most of the criticism of Israel is just of the same behavior every other country has? Why is the defense to this ""you're changing the subject, we're speaking about Israel, don't compare it to other countries?""."

It is utterly inexcusable, revolting and counter to every semblance of morality, nvm the supposedly ""most moral army in the world"". Yet it is a mainstay of the occupation and part of the everyday reality for millions of Palestinian families. Israel is the only country in the world to automatically prosecute children in military courts, it also regularly abuses children at checkpoints ([The researchers compared groups of students who had, or did not have, an obligation to cross military checkpoints manned by the Israeli Defence Force.

OMCT has been informed that these violations of human rights are continuing to occur, despite the Israeli Minister of Justice, Meir Sheetrit, having contacted the OMCT International Secretariat in order to deny these allegations and claim that Israel has never resorted to such practices.According to PCATI, children, mostly 14 to 17 years old, have been violently arrested by the security forces using such means as beatings, kicking, verbal abuse, humiliation and threats, and apparently have been interrogated illegally. During their detention, the minors were held with adult criminals and were exposed to rape, sexual harassment, theft, threats and constant physical and psychological violence.

[https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/46c190460.pdf](https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/46c190460.pdf)

The children featured in this report had no previous criminal record, and were neither recruited nor trained for violent or military action. They are ordinary Palestinian youths as can be found in many families, who used to work or attend school. The arrest during the current Intifada was their first direct encounter with the Israeli security forces. Taking advantage of the vulnerability and frailty of these children, as well as of their lack of experience, interrogators have used physical and psychological forms of torture and other ill-treatment in order to receive quick confessions. Under the shock and pain of torture and ill-treatment, children interrogated in the middle of the night, often after having been ill-treated during the arrest and transfer to a detention center, easily broke down and signed confessions written in a language, which they often did not understand.

Unfortunately the examples presented in this report do not constitute isolated or exceptional cases but are representative of attitudes and practices of Israeli law enforcement officials towards Palestinian detainees including minors. Following abuse numerous complaints requesting investigations into allegations of torture or ill-treatment have been filed with the Israeli authorities. As a state party to the Convention, Israel has the duty to carry out “prompt and impartial” investigation of complaints in order to bring to justice individuals suspected of acts of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Moreover, children who have suffered torture or illtreatment have the right to receive appropriate medical treatment or training for recovery and rehabilitation as well as compensation. We believe that as long as torturers are not punished and the state signals by its behavior that it condones the use of illegal methods of interrogation, torture and illtreatment against Palestinian detainees including minors will continue in Israel.

DCI and other human rights organisations say Palestinian children are routinely arrested at night, handcuffed, blindfolded, mistreated and denied access to their parents or a lawyer.

""For years credible reports of human rights abuses against children living under Israeli military occupation have emerged,"" he said. ""These latest testimonies from young soldiers given the task of enforcing the occupation provide further evidence of its deeply corrosive effects on all. The testimonies lay bare the day-to-day reality of the occupation. These are not isolated incidents or a question of 'a few bad apples'. This is the natural and foreseeable consequence of government policy.""

“Palestinian children arrested by (Israeli) military and police are systematically subject to degrading treatment, and often to acts of torture, are interrogated in Hebrew, a language they did not understand, and sign confessions in Hebrew in order to be released,” it said in a report.

Many are brought in leg chains and shackles before military courts, while youths are held in solitary confinement, sometimes for months, the report said.

It voiced deep concern at the “continuous use of Palestinian children as human shields and informants”, saying 14 such cases had been reported between January 2010 and March 2013 alone.

Israeli soldiers had used Palestinian children to enter potentially dangerous buildings before them and to stand in front of military vehicles to deter stone-throwing, it said.

“Almost all those using children as human shields and informants have remained unpunished and the soldiers convicted for having forced at gunpoint a nine-year-old child to search bags suspected of containing explosives only received a suspended sentence of three months and were demoted,” it said.

[https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-208566/](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-208566/)

Ill-treatment of Palestinian children in the Israeli military detention system appears
  
to be widespread, systematic and institutionalized. This conclusion is based on the
  
repeated allegations about such treatment over the past 10 years and the volume,
  
consistency and persistence of these allegations. The review of cases documented
  
through the monitoring and reporting mechanism on grave child rights violations,
  
as well as interviews conducted by UNICEF with Israeli and Palestinian lawyers and
  
Palestinian children, also support this conclusion. 

The pattern of ill-treatment includes the arrests of children at their homes between
  
midnight and 5:00 am by heavily armed soldiers; the practice of blindfolding children
  
and tying their hands with plastic ties; physical and verbal abuse during transfer to
  
an interrogation site, including the use of painful restraints; lack of access to water,
  
food, toilet facilities and medical care; interrogation using physical violence and
  
threats; coerced confessions; and lack of access to lawyers or family members during
  
interrogation.
Treatment inconsistent with child rights continues during court appearances,
  
including shackling of children; denial of bail and imposition of custodial sentences;
  
and transfer of children outside occupied Palestinian territory to serve their sentences
  
inside Israel. The incarceration isolates them from their families and interrupts their
  
studies.
 These practices are in violation of international law that protects all children against
  
ill-treatment when in contact with law enforcement, military and judicial institutions. 

2016 [https://defenceforchildren.org/dci-palestine-and-omct-present-evidence-of-abuses-against-palestinian-children-held-in-israeli-military-detention-submit-joint-report-to-cat/](https://defenceforchildren.org/dci-palestine-and-omct-present-evidence-of-abuses-against-palestinian-children-held-in-israeli-military-detention-submit-joint-report-to-cat/)

The report specifically highlights the use of excessive force by Israeli forces, including occurrences of ill-treatment and torture. From 2012-2015, DCI-Palestine collected information from affidavits of 429 children detained in the West Bank. It was found that 3/4 of these children suffered some form of physical violence following arrest. 97% of them did not have access to legal counsel and/or could not benefit from the presence of a parent and/or legal guardian during the interrogation process.
  

  
Physical violence typically consisted of children being pushed, slapped, kicked, or struck with a soldier’s helmet or rifle. Once arrested, nearly all children (97.7%) had their hands restrained, and a vast majority of them (88.3%) were blindfolded for extended periods of time. Access to basic necessities, such as food, water and sanitation, was in most cases denied during arrest, transfer, and interrogation.

Palestinian children living in the
 occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, are routinely subjected to widespread and
 systematic ill-treatment and torture and the excessive use of force by Israeli forces.

Defense for Children International – Palestine (DCIP) collected affidavits from 429 West Bank
  
children detained between 2012 and 2015 that show three-quarters of them endured some form
  
of physical violence following arrest. In 97 percent of the cases, children had no parent present
  
during the interrogation or access to legal counsel.

In its annual report last year, Amnesty International found that Israeli forces and Shin Bet personnel had “tortured and otherwise ill-treated Palestinian detainees, including children, particularly during arrest and interrogation”, with methods including “beating with batons, slapping, throttling, prolonged shackling, stress positions, sleep deprivation and threats”.

A representative of Defence for Children International – Palestine told Al Jazeera that the group’s research had shown that almost two-thirds of Palestinian children detained in the occupied West Bank by Israeli forces had endured physical violence after their arrest.

Torture and ill-treatment are so rife, human rights campaigners say, that convictions of Palestinians for “security offences” are fundamentally unreliable, not least because the abuse is part of a wider lack of due process.
  

  
According to one study, as many as 91 percent of Palestinian detainees interrogated by the Shin Bet in the occupied West Bank are held incommunicado for either part or all of their interrogation. Stroumsa says this practice is “an enabling element for torture”

Even though roughly 1,000 complaints alleging torture by members of the Israeli security forces have been filed since 2001, no criminal investigations have been opened against them.

According to the Amnesty International Report on human rights for the years 2016and 2017, in spite of the torture complaints filed with the Israeli Ministry of Justicesince 2014, no drastic change could be detected in dealing with cases of torture carried out by Shabak interrogators. Since 2001, more than a thousand torture complaints against Palestinian detainees, including women and children, have been filed. From these, none were investigated and none of the interrogators who carried out the torture were held accountable for their actions

The 73-page report, “Isolated and Alone: Palestinian children held in solitary confinement by Israeli authorities for interrogation,” evaluates and details patterns of arrest, detention conditions, and interrogation practices by Israeli authorities. The report concludes that the physical and social isolation of Palestinian children for interrogation purposes by Israeli authorities is a practice that constitutes solitary confinement, amounting to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment under international law norms.

Israel verbally and physically tortures Palestinian children in detention and during their interrogation, Arab48.com reported on Monday. According to the lawyer of the PLO Prisoners' and Freed Prisoners' Commission, Heba Aghbariyeh, most of the children in question were subjected to such torture.

[https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/131960](https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/131960)

It said that 160 children under the age of 18 are currently serving terms in Israeli jails, including three girls, two of them 16 years of age and the third 17, and five are held in administrative detention without charge or trial and based on secret evidence.
  

  
The PPS said in its report that most of the children were subjected to all sorts of physical and psychological torture during their detention in violation of international agreements and conventions on the rights of children.

2023 [https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/news/media-centre/press-releases/-treated-like-animals----palestinian-children-suffer-inhumane-tr](https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/news/media-centre/press-releases/-treated-like-animals----palestinian-children-suffer-inhumane-tr)

81% endured physical beatings and 89% suffered verbal abuse.
  
52% were threatened with harm to their families.
  
86% were subjected to strip searches, leaving them humiliated and ashamed.
  
88% did not receive adequate and timely healthcare, even when explicitly requested.
  
Almost half (47%) were denied contact with a lawyer.

“Children as young as twelve have told us about truly inhumane treatment in the Israeli military detention system. There is no possible justification for setting dogs on children, beating them, or shackling them to metal chairs. Whatever they are accused of, regardless of guilt or innocence, these children must be treated first and foremost as children – with all the special protections this entails.
  

  
“No child should be experiencing such cruelty at the hands of those who are meant to be looking after them. Children should no longer be prosecuted in military courts – and there has never been greater urgency to release children from prison as systemic ill-treatment is compounded by the threat of COVID-19 in detention centres. Only with these changes can we prevent irrevocable damage being inflicted on generations of Palestinian children.”

“It’s been over eight years since the UK’s own Children in Military Custody report highlighted the devastating injustices faced by Palestinian children in Israeli military custody. Since then, thousands more detained children have suffered systematic abuse, all while the recommendations made to fix a broken justice system have gone nowhere.

This month marks 8 years since a delegation of UK lawyers reviewed the treatment of Palestinian children under Israeli military law and published their findings and recommendations.\[1\] The Foreign Office funded report – Children in Military Custody – found undisputed evidence that the military detention system violates at least 6 articles under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and 2 articles under the Fourth Geneva Convention.\[2\] The report concluded by making 40 recommendations.

This provides undeniable proof that Israel has, for decades, systematically and intentionally traumatised, tortured, abused and raped Palestinian children in detention. Despite decades of reports and condemnations, including by government ally's like the UK, the practice remains widespread and the default. It would actually be more rare for a child in custody to not be abused, than to be abused. This is ofcourse whilst the child cannot possibly represent harm to his abuser, nvm civilians. This is NOT a question of bad apples, but a rotten tree. That is obvious and undeniable. This shows a blatant disregard for human rights, and a clear active disdain for Palestinians and their children. Their is nothing that could possibly be said to justify this, except by someone who doesn't see Palestinians and their children as human and worthy of any respect and rights. This isn't a ""mistake"", or simply unfortunate. It's evil. "

**The Resolution states: Israel is not a racist or apartheid state, Congress rejects all forms of Antisemitism and xenophobia, and the United States will always be a stanch partner and supporter of Israel.** 

&#x200B;

The House of Reps agreed that calling Israel an apartheid state is false, relies on fabricated definitions, irrational demonization of Israel and gross application of double standards. 

&#x200B;

It should have been a unanimous vote, but the following 9 Democrat representatives oppose Israel every chance they get: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), Rashid Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Jamaal Bowman, Delia Ramirez, Cori Bush, Summer Lee, Andre Carson and Ayanna Pressley. 

&#x200B;

The vote to approve the resolution comes after of Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s visit to the White House Tuesday and ahead of his address to a joint meeting of Congress a day later, which some progressives have said they’ll skip, citing concerns about human rights. Notably, Tlaib and Omar did not attend Herzog's speech. But when it comes to Assad, whose usage of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians is well-documented, Omar and Tlaib voted to lift US sanctions on Syria. 

&#x200B;

What do you call a person who believes Israel is racist simply by being a Jewish state, but has never called 79 countries that enshrine religion in their government racist? You can call that person an Antisemite."

I've been studying using the resources from the SHJ and preparing to officially convert. However, now that I'm about to finish everything, it seems like it might be a waste of time. Am I really just paying money to get a piece of paper? Or is there a benefit?

The only synagogues in my country are Chabad. Would I be welcomed there and allowed to join in for holiday/shabbat celebrations or would they shun me? Would me having converted to Humanistic Judaism mean that my future children would automatically be Jewish or not?

I live in a mixed American and Israeli neighborhood in Jerusalem and my neighbor in the apartment next door to me runs a daycare. It's a government funded daycare for working parents but I can't remember the word for it. This neighbor has always seemed a little dysfunctional but a lot of it I chalk up to culture differences coming from America. I would personally never send a child of mine to her group but she has about 7 or 8 babies in her care. There's constant screaming coming from next door, and she lets the kids crawl around in the dirt in the courtyard. I've sometimes seen her put the babies in the hallway of our building and have her very young daughters watch them. When I talk to people about this, they all say it's pretty normal for the daycares here and I know that some of the parents in the group have seen this and seem ok with it. I work from home so I can hear the babies crying all morning and some of them aren't picked up till 4 pm.

Today, I heard the babies screaming outside my door. That's normal for when she lets them play in the hallway. But then I heard a child fall down the steps. I opened my door, and my neighbor was in her apartment with the door closed and her maybe 8 year old daughter supervising. The baby was on the landing below our floor, having ridden his little bike down the steps. He was just laying there screaming. The 8 year old only got up to get the baby once she saw me go running. The baby had a bloody nose and it seemed like not much worse, but I had to then tell the kid to go get her mother instead of just staring at me holding this screaming baby. She got her mother, and when I tried to explain what happened, she just grabbed the baby and went inside. She literally did not care. The baby is still screaming as I write this.

My husband claims even if I try to report her, all of these home daycares in this area are run this way and are totally dysfunctional by ""American standards"". I don't think that's true and I think something has to be done about her. So is there a place to report her? Previously it was just screaming babies and a dysfunctional vibe, which isn't exactly a reportable offense, but this was actual negligence that could have ended in serious injury. These are rough stone steps and that baby fell about 20 feet. If I do try to report her somewhere will I be identified as the person reporting? If I'm about to ruin someone's source of income I would not like for them to know it was me. I'm very unsure what to do."

What are your (modern) Jewish culture book recommendations?


For myself I’ve read, and recommend 

Antisemitism:
* antisemitism here and now 
* people love dead Jews 
* it could happen here (the adl book)
* this one by an English & Jewish comedian that I forgot the title 

Israel & Palestine peace process  books:
* I shall not hate (written by a Palestinian doctor from Gaza) 
* A Palestinians guide to collective liberation (written by a Palestinian peace activist) 
*I’ve read others but I thought they were less interesting 


Has anyone read 
* Colonialism & the Jews (2017), I heard it was recommended at an ADL event recently 

Any book reconmendations for memoirs & personal accounts of the flight of Jews from the Middle East ~ 1948?

Anyone remember the book title of the Sephardi Jewish diary & letters recently found in a Victorian English home ? My non-Jewish friend was reading it in a coffee shop and I thought it was interesting"

Do you have any book recommendations on the peace progress and peace efforts on the ground by interesting people? Strong preference to memoirs and personal accounts 

I’ve read “I shall not hate” & “A Palestinians guide to collective liberation” which are both very good (imo) Palestinian perspectives of peace activists (not really politicians). 

Are there any similar Israeli perspective books (in English)?

I’ve heard and own “the lemon tree” and “letters to my Palestinian neighbor” would those suffice?

1,2023-07-19,Ahaz’s Fertility,u/aquabluesong,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1548bjk/ahazs_fertility/,"Ahaz began his reign at 20 years old and reigned 16 years. But his son Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:2) was twenty-five years old at his accession, and so must have been born when Ahaz was not more than eleven.
Some speculate Solomon was also in his early teen when Rehoboam was born.
Biologically, a male has to hit the puberty to produce a functional sperm; and the average male age of entering the puberty is 12-13.
If Ahaz indeed has become a father at the age of 11, he would have entered his puberty no later than age of 10. 
Did King David Line have a precocious puberty?
It makes me wonder if they had familial hypothyroidism (esp given the fact King David was not able to keep his body warm later in his life) or possibly congenital adrenal hyperplasia 
Or was 10 years old entering the puberty phase not out of norm at the time?"

First, getting the willpower and energy to pray. I find it very difficult to get up and pray, I can hardly get out of the bed in the morning or do small tasks. Praying is something I want to get better at but I don't have the power. 

Secon and this is my biggest issue, whenever I do pray, my words feel empty. It feels like every word I say just bounces right back to me and it doesn't have any true meaning. My words feel empty as if I'm speaking to myself or that they're strapped to a rocket going up that loses its fuel before it reaches the moon. I feel like I'm just reading a few paragraphs but my hearts not in it.
Sometimes when I'm praying I'll raise my voice and when I do that I really feel something! But I don't want to scream to feel like I'm being heard. 
I want to pray and feel like Hashem is listening and understanding and I need a little guidance and advice from anyone who is willing to offer it."

I tried posting this on R/writingadvice however the community's rules were way too strict so I'm posting here

As the title says I am writing a story of mine, however I realize that some if the plot ideas have anti-semitism roots. I didn't know about this when I used them as ideas, I only found out very recently and I would like advice of actual Jewish people but since I don't know any in real life I'm posting it here

It is going to be complicated if you don't know my story but the basics is this. A evil entity is living hidden in a castle belonging to royalty after being casted out by its creators, this entity saved them from a drought and has basically worshiped and has been hidden for centuries since then, only the leaders in society know about it and have access to it. This entity also feeds on a very specific group of people so these people are regularly sacrificed to it so it can grow stronger and it needs to be hidden or else it's creators will find it and kill it

This is the gist of it and my main problem. I heard that the whole idea of a blood sacrifices and politicians belonging to a secret society is rooted in anti-semitism. I don't want any of that in my story but it's also so crucial to the plot that I can't take it out. I want to know if this is far enough away from anti-semitism that it's ok or if I need to change it

Generally I loathe guided tours. You spend 6 hours in a minibus so you can spend two hours at the destination. They always want to waste your time with some bullshit carpet store or trinket store. And I always get stuck with unfriendly couples who insist on speaking to each other in their home language even though their English is perfectly good.

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

Life gives us choices, reality restricts these choices.

The 20th century philosopher [Jean-Paul Satre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre), viewed life as a  dichotomy between choice and facticity. Facticity encompasses the unchangeable constants of life, such as our identities, limitations in our abilities, birth circumstances, and basic needs like food, safety, and fulfilling our obligations to loved ones. 

However, often, we might overestimate facticity rather than underestimating it. We navigate through life and make important decisions, or sometimes fail to make them, as if we have fewer choices than we actually do. It is possible that there are many more possibilities available to us than we realize. Sometimes, the challenge lies in being able to see all the options that are truly open to us.

Why do we fail to see these options? Why do we automatically dismiss possibilities without giving them serious consideration? Why do many options never even enter our minds?

We often reject potential choices because we fear the unknown consequences that may result from those decisions. We feel anxious about failure and stepping out of our perceived comfort zones. In many cases, the dangers we imagine are improbable, yet even the slightest chance of those outcomes frightens us away.

There are various other reasons why we fail to pause our current path and question whether another path may be better. The stress of our present situation may not allow us the time to consider alternatives. The momentum of our current missions may seem too substantial to change course. We become so fixated on the immediate challenges we face that our perspective becomes narrow. Sometimes, we simply lack the quiet time and energy necessary for contemplation or creative brainstorming that would enable us to reshape our thinking and come up with entirely new ideas.

In his book [Walden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden), its author [Henry Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau) describes living in a cabin next to a lake for over two years, living almost exclusively on the produce of his own hands. Although such a lifestyle may not appeal to most people, the crucial point is how far our lives have become detached from our basic needs. Many of the things we believe we cannot live without are likely just illusions of difficulty.

Our civilization has advanced to a point where most of us are relatively far from the risk of severe deprivation. Even in societies with limited welfare systems, safety nets are in place to alleviate these low-probability fears. Our world has changed, and most of our fundamental needs are easily accessible, yet we have not fully grasped this new reality.

Imagine that in a moment of creativity, either alone or in discussion with others, you come up with a new option. Your initial thoughts may be that it is impossible.

It really is hard to define, but I'll try my best: anti-Semitism is the trump card Jews play when they want to officially disregard an argument they don't like. 

e.g. 

Most of the Jews are rich => anti-Semitism

Sweeden allowing the torah burning (after they just allowed the Quran burning) => anti-Semitism

Hitler was a good leader => anti-Semitism

the Jews have a victim mentality  => anti-Semitism

*and God forbid*, the holocaust was probably exaggerated => anti-Semitism

&#x200B;

Fortunately- Currently at least- there is still a sort of separation when it comes to criticizing the Nakba, the Palestinian's children death, and the sole existence of this so called ""nation"". We can express our opinions in public without the fear of being cancelled or even jailed because it's anti-Zionism, not anti-Semitism. 

&#x200B;

This is why I believe the Jews are big supporters of the whole anti-Semitism = anti-Zionism thing. Because the moment this become a globally recognized thing, a single critique of ""israel"" would be the equivalent of the worst crime in the 21'st century, questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust.

I know it's not a technical support forum but maybe my problem happened to some people here too and someone will be able to help. Here's what's going on :
My phone operator is HOT Mobile (I know, not the best choice but anyway). I always received confirmation SMS from abroad like bank, paypal, etc. since suddenly about two weeks ago when I went abroad. Since then I came back to Israel and I don't receive any SMS from short-numbers from abroad. Any other types of SMS, from private numbers from Israel and other countries, work.
I though it might be from within the phone parameters so I tried to activate premium numbers messages but I actually can't so I called HOT multiple times and they told me ""that they fixed the problem"" but didn't do shit.
So, before I change operator, maybe someone here had they same issue and know how to fix it ? Thanks ! :)"

After doing some research, I discovered her family practiced Judaism in their home and kept it a secret out of fear of persecution. Later, I assume she either converted or kept it a secret from her husband that she was Jewish and raised her children Christian (I couldn’t confirm this but this is what I assumed what happened).

Because of this, I want to be able to celebrate my family’s culture in a time where being Jewish isn’t something that must be kept hidden. I identity as Jewish and I consider myself Pagan as well. However, I feel like if I only practice traditional / cultural customs of Judaism I’m not Jewish and I feel like I am doing more wrong than good."

By that I mean we have a lot of features people typically associate with Ashkenazi jewish people (large, hooked noses, dark curly hair, etc.) to the point where a majority of my life I've been presumed jewish and spent my highschool years being known as ""jewfro"" and some other unsavory nicknames I'd prefer not to repeat.

I've been interested in Judaism since I learned about it when I was 13 and now that I will soon be moving to a larger city with synagogues and actual jewish communities I've been entertaining the idea of contacting one of the Rabbis to learn more about Judaism, if that life is one I want to pursue, and what it would mean to convert. This is not a choice I wish to make frivolously, I believe that'd be a disservice both to myself and any potential culture I'd being joining.

I'm hesitant to go through with it, admittedly a little selfishly. The jewish community in the city isn't *huge* and I'm worried looking more visibly jewish could lead to increased harassment.

I know the right answer is to shoulder through even if it's tough, but I also frequently take care of young (infant to child aged) family members and I couldn't bear it if my decisions made it harder for them to live without prejudice for their features.

Any advice or words of wisdom would be appreciated. I have a few jewish friends I've talked to about this but theyre atheist and live in very liberal cities so I was hoping to get a more rounded perspective on things and thought you guys might be able to help."

The Mars 360 system defines everyone on the basis of personality and allows everyone to improvise with the individual as they navigate through life. There are examples in the book that show exactly how Arabs and Jews will become united.

The book also exhorts Israel to create an AI bot representative of the force of conflict and war that has plagued the nations for centuries, so that such a force may be constrained to the bot and removed from the lives of everyday humans. This is meant to have global reach and implications.

I've been invited to sing in a local Reform temple's choir as part of their upcoming holiday services. I'm not Jewish and I grew up in a Christian household, and I've only been to this temple once before. Is there anything I should be careful to do (or not do) during rehearsals beyond, like, basic respect and courtesy? What sort of thing would make you say ""oh, he probably doesn't know any better but I really wish he wouldn't do that""? I don't want to be that guy :)

In case it matters, rehearsals will be on Saturday mornings and they'll be in the temple building but probably not in the sanctuary. And I assume the choir director knows I'm not Jewish, but is that something I should bring up directly with her or with the rabbi, or does it matter for singing at the holiday services?

I've been thinking about this recently because of the operation in the Jenin refugee camp so I decided to look for insight. I think that the framing of the discussion surrounding the conflict a lot of the time isn't ideal. When people talk about the conflict(at least from my experience), it's generally in the context of Israel and the PA or Israel and Hamas or the Islamic Jihad. I don't see a lot of people talking about the Palestinian people, who honestly seem to bear the brunt of the consequences of the conflict despite not really being in any position of power.

The end of June saw a huge wave of attacks on Palestinian villages, with Umm Safa, Turmus Ayya, Jalud, Baytin and more villages dealing with fires and property destruction from settlers. With all due respect to the operation in Jenin, the refugee camp was essentially rendered uninhabitable after the operation and when you hear palestinians describe the operation it sounds almost ghoulish. According to Israel, 28 Israelis have been killed by Palestinians this year; According to the PA, over 200 Palestinians have been killed either by settlers or by the IDF this year. Even if that's an exaggeration by five-fold, there are still significantly more Palestinian casualties that Israeli casualties.

I'm not trying to say that because they have it worse they're the right side or that whoever has more casualties is in the right, but I'm honestly confused as to why the Palestinian people aren't the focus of the discussion. They suffer not only from settlers and the outcomes of IDF operations but also from the PA and Hamas that(as mentioned by many people in this subreddit) are corrupt and militarist extremists."

Judges' appointments to government's hand,

A reform that many don't understand.

Corruption trial, a court case.

Supporting changes from afar,

Opposition cries, ""Checks and balance!""

Accusations of a power imbalance.

A regime change, they firmly state,

As the government pushes to dominate.

A wider process, an agreement to paint.

Illegalities seen with an eagle's eye.

Antisemitism vs anti Arab racism,u/EagleSimilar2352,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1557np2/double_standards_antisemitism_vs_anti_arab_racism/,"First of all I believe all racism is wrong and disgusting. Now hear me out. Criticism of Israel or Zionism is often labeled as antisemitic, while it's true that some people often criticize Israel in antisemitic way I believe the same is true when it comes to criticism of Palestinians as well. Examples:
1)Zionists say: you can't deny the right of Jews to build a homeland in Israel or their right to self determination cause it's anti semitic. At the same time both in this sub and elsewhere many Zionist constantly deny any right of self determination or statehood for Palestinians. How is this not anti Palestinian racism? Either both are hateful or none of them are. If I say Scotland shouldn't be an independent country is that hateful against Scottish people? I'm not making any claims here just asking.
2) some Zionists claim most Palestinians came recently from neighboring Arab countries and therefore have no rights to the land,some use catch phrase like ""Palestinians have no identity''. How is this any less racist than saying Jews have zero rights to the land or pushing conspiracy theories like ""Jews are khazars"" etc? 
3) many zionists complain about antisemitic tropes while also using anti Arab tropes and stereotypes like claiming Arabs are naturally violent, claiming Islam teaches them to hate Jews etc. How is that different than claiming the Judaism teaches Jews to be racist because of some quotes from the Bible or the Talmud without context?"

I believe this point is both kinda racist and silly. Yes Palestine as an independent country never existed but so many other countries especially in the middle east and Africa that gained independence after European colonization. By using this argument you aren't just denying Palestinian self determination but also implying countries like Nigeria or Kenya shouldn't exist because there was never an indipendent country called Nigeria or Kenya before the 1960. Same applies pretty much all countries in the Americas including the US , they all came to be in the last 250 years. If we go back in history enough all countries had go start somewhere. 
Yes Palestine as an independent country doesn't exist right now but this doesn't mean it shouldn't exist in the future just because there wasn't an independent Palestine before. This point is also based on the assumption that Israel is any different. Israel is an ancient name but it's not a direct continuation of the ancient kingdom of Israel and by the way there's huge skepticism when it comes to the notion of a historical unified Kingdom of Israel ever existing. Israel as we know it today is a modern country founded in 1947-1948."

My surname's origins have always been a mystery in my family. I have never met one single person with it except my my sister and obviously my father. It's only 4 letters long and when I have to give my full name people i have to repeat it like 10 times. I've even been told if I'm really sure it's written like that. There's about 15000 living people with that exact surname so I traced the name as far back as I could on my lineage and it led to a Portuguese man in 1693. His name was S. Rodriguez and he emigrated to the Caribbean (sounds pretty generic, no?). But here's the deal, when he got there and married, his children's surname wasn't Rodriguez it was like a Portuguese misspelling of my last name. Their children and descendants had the names Simon, Miriam, Joseph, Josepha, Balthazar, Blas. The new surname stuck and later it changed only one consonant. Even with the changed consonant the sound of the last syllable ends in ""ch"". My sister's ancestry records were about 46% Portuguese. Is there a possibility that my ancestors were forced into a name change and/or conversion, went into exile to the Caribbean and finally reclaimed their true name and lost it's meaning over the generations?

Added bit: my father lived in Brooklyn a few years back and there were a couple of people whom he met that asked him if he was Jewish when they heard his last name."

So I am 19 and am in college and growing up I was forced to be raised Evangelical Christian. This was solely done by my very physically and mentally abusive, racist, and antisemitic father. My mom did not want me to be raised in the church but was not given a choice by my father. I never believed or followed the church, but only got out when my mom divorced my father and he lost child custody. During my childhood my mom had told me that I was Jewish, but because of my father I was never allowed to investigate or show that part of myself. Once the divorce happened I was finally able to explore Judaism.

However, this is where things get complicated. So my mom was adopted as a baby and raised in a non-Jewish/religious home. She knows a little bit about her birth parents but not much. Really all she knows about them from her adopted mother is that her father was Scotch-Irish and her mother was Jewish. Therefore, through maternal lines I believe I am Jewish. The only problem is that there is no “proof” of this. I do not know their names, and I don’t have any paper connection. So I wouldn’t be able to prove it for things like birthright etc. My mom has done some dna testing but that has not really helped confirm or disprove anything.

This mixed with my lack of a Jewish upbringing has led to me feeling uncomfortable trying to explore that identity. What do you all think, am I Jewish, and do you have any opinions on what I should do? I’ve been doing stuff online for a while to educate myself, such as watching Shabbat livestreams every Friday evening, learning Hebrew on my own, and celebrating holidays to the best of my abilities by following books and guides. I am totally willing to convert if that is needed.

I have gone to my university’s Hillel a few times last year, but felt like I shouldn’t be there as everyone else there had there was raised Jewish, had their bar/bat mitzvah, had Jewish names, while I had none of that and have one of the most Scottish Gaelic names you could possibly have. (I don’t have any problems with my name and like it, but I got a lot of weird/confused/rude looks at Hillel when introducing myself). I would love to get more involved this year, and am actually thinking about trying to rush aepi.

Sorry for the very long post, but does anyone have any thoughts or recommendations? Thanks!"

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

We know very little about what's really going on. In our quest for the truth, we rely on newspapers, TV, the internet, and books, but no single source can be trusted. Errors, simplifications, bias, and misinformation are everywhere.

We live in a vast, even global, society. The decisions and events that affect us also impact billions of others. These numbers are too large for the time-honored method of seeking facts by asking someone who was present. We don't know any of the people involved well enough to trust everything they say, or the people close to them. Even if we do know someone involved, they may not have the complete picture and will interpret what they see according to their own beliefs.

Even when speakers have access to true facts, they often choose to hide some and promote others. Ideology frequently allows people to distort the truth.

However, all hope is not lost. There are tools available to discern some truth. We understand how people generally behave. We know the workings of the human mind, what is likely or unlikely, and what could lead people to lie. Our past experiences provide valuable insights into whom we can trust and who peddles nonsense. We can infer the truth by employing logic and drawing from our experiences.

The problem is that none of these methods can offer certainty; inferences are always uncertain. The human mind craves certainty, and we are not naturally inclined to doubt our positions. We cling to the notion that we still live in a time when we could rely on knowledge acquired through direct contact.

We fear the paralysis that could result from uncertainty and doubt. If we are unsure or if our data is potentially flawed, how can we move forward, make decisions, and implement our visions for the future?

Nevertheless, we are expected to make decisions. In societies other than the darkest authoritarian regimes, we are called upon to take action, make decisions, and support a chosen path. How can we do this if misinformation paralyzes us?

The answer lies in recognizing that inaction is often as bad as making poor choices. Our past experiences and logical inferences are better than nothing. We have no alternative but to make decisions, even if it means deciding not to take action. We must follow the path that seems most reasonable, but also remain aware that we might be incorrect. We must remember that we are navigating through a haze of disinformation, and that our understanding will be an imperfect simplification, at best. Despite our good intentions, our actions may inadvertently lead to harm.

Moving forward with uncertainty is challenging. If we project doubt to others, who will believe us or cooperate with our vision? Therefore, we may project a sense of certainty, but the danger is that we may eventually start believing it ourselves. Speaking as if we are certain has a profound impact on us, the speaker, and we soon forget that we do not possess all the facts.

As we forget our own ignorance and become convinced that the path we have chosen is the only plausible one, we feel anger towards those who disagree, challenge our facts, and propose an alternative path.

Therefore, we should never forget that we were forced to select one option among many for moving forward. When encountering those who chose differently, we should try to remember that they might be right. We can remain loyal to our choices without belittling those who disagree with us.

Never stop doing but never stop doubting."

1,2023-07-21,____ is a terrorist state,u/Shachar2like,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/155inbd/is_a_terrorist_state/,"# Definition and Overview

According to [state terrorism in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_terrorism) there isn't an agreed definition by an academic or an international legal consensus.

Some use it to mean violent action used with the predominant intention of causing terror against non-combatants

Others like governments, international organizations, private institutions and scholars believe that the definition is ""actor-centric"" and is dependent on who performed it (a state or a non-state actor) which emphasizes the characteristics of the group/individual.

Even if the definition allowed & defined states in 'state terrorism'. Those state actions are usually seen as a war or self-defense and not terror. While states may accuse each other of [State sponsored terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_terrorism) when they support or fund insurgencies or militant groups. Individuals who accuse a government of terrorism are seen as radicals because actions by governments are seen as legitimate.

The encyclopedia of Britannica definition is

>""the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective""   
>  
>""establishment terrorism, often called state or state-sponsored terrorism, is employed by governments—or more often by factions within governments—against that government's citizens, against factions within the government, or against foreign governments or groups."" 

Most usage of the word refers to militants or insurgents but some scholars like Michael Stohl that in international relations the use of terror is a common tactic. The terrorism in this case, the threat of violence has a broader purpose then simply physical harm and the audiance is more important then the immediate victim (the politician)

Scholar Gus Martin's definition:

>""committed by governments and quasi-governmental agencies and personnel against perceived threats""

&#x200B;

Scholar Noam Chomsky's definition:

>""terrorism practised by states (or governments) and their agents and allies"" 

&#x200B;

Scholar Simon Taylor's definition:

>""state agents using threats or acts of violence against civilians, marked by a callous indifference to human life, to instill fear in a community beyond the initial victim for the purpose of preventing a change or challenge to the status quo."" 

&#x200B;

To summarize: the general acceptance is that terrorism applies to insurgence and not to states but there are still some who do recognize this definition.

&#x200B;

# Criticism to The Concept

 

The definition ignores a series of rules applied at the state level which governs how they conduct warfare. there is a ""fundamental qualitative difference between the two types of violence.""  
Even in war, there are rules and accepted norms of behaviour that prohibit certain types of weapons and tactics and outlaw attacks on specific categories of targets.  
For instance, rules which are codified in the Geneva and Hague Conventions on warfare prohibit taking civilians as hostages, outlaw reprisals against either civilians or POWs, recognise neutral territory, etc.

  
even the most cursory review of terrorist tactics and targets over the past quarter century reveals that terrorists have violated all these rules. When states transgress these rules of war the term ""war crime"" is used to describe such acts.  


This argument of state-terrorism has been used by the terrorists themselves, arguing that there is no difference between their activities and those by governments and states (similar to virtue signaling trying to imply that both are the same). It has also been employed by some sympathizers, and it rests on the deliberate obfuscation between all kinds of violence...

&#x200B;

>""The use of force by states is already regulated under international law.  regardless of the differences between governments on the question of the definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is any deliberate attack on innocent civilians \[or non-combatants\], regardless of one's cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism."" 

[Kofi Annan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan) \- a Ghanaian diplomat who served as the seventh secretary-general of the United Nations from 1997 to 2006.

&#x200B;

>State Terrorism is not an international legal concept, and when states abuse their powers they should be judged against international conventions which deal with war crimes, international human rights law, and international humanitarian law, rather than international anti-terrorism statutes.  

Chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee.

&#x200B;

So that's the short version of the definition & criticism about it so next time somebody uses this excuse you know the definition and problems with the definition."

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth and relaxed the airport security process was. Comparing it to my experiences in other countries, particularly the United States and Germany, where security measures can be quite stringent, Tel Aviv Airport was refreshingly hassle-free. I simply placed my bag on the conveyor belt without needing to open it or remove anything, and there were no visible police or firearms, which was comforting. It's intriguing to see how Tel Aviv manages security with such ease, especially given its geopolitical context. I wonder if this is unique to the city's approach."

They betrayed their own kind and disobeyed God. The blame is always placed on the individual, but very little effort goes into *why* the person went off the derech. 

I come from an observant community and every single person I know who left the community did so because of trauma. Not because their life philosophy changed or they one day decided they liked to eat non-kosher food. No one wants to feel unwelcome or be forced to leave for their own comunnity for safety or sanity. It often has to do with family problems, abuse/bullying within the community, and things like this. 

These people often go off and intermarry with non-Jews. Observant communities will always assume the person made a logical decision to leave and not realize that it comes from trauma. Is it just me who notices a complete lack of empathy or understanding? Families are more prepared to excommunicate their own than to try and include Jews who are traumatized out of the community. Surely this isn't the way? If a Jew marries out, doesn't the community have an *obligation* to do what they can so that the Jewish individual and their family has a fair chance to be included into the fold? "

That quote about repeating a lie so much that it becomes the truth is perfectly applicable here. 

I wish I could speak to a Rabbi about this but I doubt it's socially acceptable to show up at a synagogue demanding his attention. I don't know a single Jewish person irl.

I was wondering if anyone here is part of a European Jewish community, as my mom grew up largely removed from the Jewish community in her country as most made aliyah in the 20th century. I am guessing most people here are probably of Ashkenazi descent from North America, but are removed a few generations from their ancestors who lived in Europe. I was wondering because I feel like I know very little about the culture of European Jews who survived and didn't leave after the Holocaust. My mother told me growing up in the 60s/70s she was told not to let others know she was Jewish. But she still said that she knew many people like her, Jewish, not religious, and not making aliyah.

I’m currently working on a translation of a collection of letters (1937-1943), written by a Bohemian, German-speaking Jewish doctor, who, with his letters, kept the grandparents and other family members posted about his three daughters and their development amidst the rising tensions in Bohemia, the family’s precipitately flight to the Netherlands and the ever increasing hostile circumstances over there. The letters stop when the family is arrested and deported. They survive the camps, but the parents die from illness in the aftermath of the Lost Transport near Tröbitz, Germany, just after being liberated. The daughters however survive.

This is the sad and horrific backdrop to my very mundane translation question, concerning something  cultural/culinary. In a few letters, it is mentioned that the family celebrates *Lichterfest*, Hanukkah. During the celebration they eat *Zuckis*, sometimes written as *Zuckiz* (possibly just a variation or typo), singular *Zucki*. For various reasons I think it concerns a rather small and sweet treat – not in the least because of the similarity to the German word for sugar, *Zucker.* But if they are a kind of sweet pastry or rather a candy-like treat, I don't know.

I’ve been looking for a source that describes this treat, but to no avail. Does anyone here know what they are and if they’re known by any other name? It is possible I just leave the name in German in my Dutch translation, but I want to know what a *Zucki* is, just to be sure."

 I find TA to be very hit or miss, hard to choose amongst the million options, never knowing if a speaker/Rav is reliable to listen to for some halachic topics, 'accredited', 'too' right wing and preaching what's not usually paskined, etc.  Others find this?  Anyone know the requirements for being allowed to post on TA?    I do like that there is something to learn here about almost anything you can think up. The app itself is amazing and I objectively know the huge impact TA makes for yiddishkeit in terms of accessibility - it's absolutely amazing in that respect...

OU rabbis just all 'seem' more professional, knowdgeable, accredited (most have high positions in more popular orgs) etc. But maybe it's presentation and my ignorance lol (can you tell I'm a b'al yeshiva... Not a yeahivish/orthodox hinuch growing up).  There's a lot of content but it's focused and not unmanageable.    The apps always glitch though, which is unfortunate.

I have a quick question regarding the options that I have to travel under the Shabbat from Airport to Tel Aviv and viceversa.

If I am not wrong:
- no public transportation
- I can take a sherut - shared taxi —> price? Can I book in advance?
- taxi (I read around 300 nis but with the app Gett I got 150 nis, which one is correct?)

Exists some carpool or private ride shared like Waze or BlaBlaCar?
There are some cheap shuttle on these days?

Some other ideas?

Thanks you :)"

I also see a lot of really negative comments on YouTube mocking ashkenazi food, our facial features, language, music, but don't see the same hatred in these comments for Sephardic food, music, or physical attraction.

No one definition is going to be an objective undebatable reference, and no single definition is going to encompass all it means to be indigenous on its own. Yet, all too often, when talking about Palestine a group will assert their definition of indigeneity, whatever it is, as superior and absolute. Plunging what could otherwise be a fruitful discussion about the conflict into an emotional debate about which politically convenient definition is most apt. Instead I thought I'd provide a quick summary of various understandings to show why I think the term is useless in conveying the actual point. 

 It's also important to just quickly establish the fact that not all peoples are indigenous. The lines of course will always be debateable but its clear from a quick google search, any reading of literature on indigenous groups and just general usage of the term that not everyone is indigenous. Their is some qualifying factor that differentiates indigenous from non-indigenous peoples  I.E the term applies for American Indians, and not the French.  That being said it is very possibly to maliciously appropriate the term for political means. Here I'll try to list a couple different distinct but overlapping understandings of the term. Starting with the most common.

1. Indigeneity as a result of \*contemporary\* colonialism.

""Indigenesnous is an identity constructed shaped and lived in the politicised context of contemporary colonialism. The communities, clans, nations and tribes we call indigenous peoples are just that: indigenous to the lands they inhabit, in contrast to and in contention with the colonial societies and states that have spread out from Europe and other centres of empire. It is this oppositional place-based existence along with the consciousness of being in struggle against the dispossessing and demeaning fact of colonization by foreign peoples, that fundamentally distinguishes indigenous peoples from other peoples of the world. ""

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/44483133](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44483133) (By North American indigenous authors  Taiaike Alfred and Jeff Corntassel)

[Often indigenous peoples are referred to as the disadvantaged descendants of the peoples that inhabited a territory prior to colonization or the formation of the existing state (Joona, 2012; International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs).....In addition, indigenous peoples are not in a ruling position in the modern society and they want to maintain, develop, and transmit the inherited lands and ethnical identity to the future generations. Their ethnic identity forms the existence of the people as one, unitary population in harmony with their own cultural practices, social institutions, and legal systems (Cobo, 1986).](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=28f51fc98b0ab24527ced26b593ce747038b69c9#page=379)

Currently, the only definition of indigenous peoples that is legally binding (for its signatories) is the one provided by the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 169; indigenous peoples are peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the population which inhabited the country, or geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of colonization or conquest or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions.

Similar ideas are shown in the UN working definition

“Indigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing on those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal system.

Notice clearly the ""non-dominant"" groups of society, their struggle to maintain their cultural traditions when faced with that dominant group, as well as the pre-colonial/pre-settler aspects.

So, yes, under this understanding indigeneity ends when colonialism does. Just as the term coloniser does. Algeria is a great example of this. ""Many have noted that applying the term indigenous to an African context is problematic since the colonial encounter tended to make all Africans ""indigenous"" relative to the colonizing powers (see Maybury-Lewis 1997:7-8; Veber and Waehle 1993:9-15). However, in the postcolonial context, finer distinctions are being drawn in order to describe and address current power asymmetries among various ethnic communities. In order to sharpen the contrast between ""indigenous"" Africans and other Africans"" [3](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1525/aa.2002.104.4.1074) Thus Algerian Arabs are no longer indigenous, after the end of French colonisation the title of Indigenous is best attributed today to the Amazigh and Tuareg people.  Indians, Pakistanis, Chinese even British were all colonised at some point by invading armies. Today though, they, and the vast majority of the world, are not indigenous peoples despite this. So clearly, past relationship to colonialism is not directly relevant, or else practically all peoples would be indigenous. Which is again not the case. 

2. Originating somewhere/first peoples.

As seen in earlier definitions inhabiting the region prior to invasion and/or the modern borders is a very common distinguishing factor present amongst indigenous peoples. It is also common to define indigenous peoples as simply  [""the descendants of the first human inhabitants of the land""](https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/nzjpubinl1&div=7&id=&page=).

&#x200B;

3. Material connection and link to the land on which they live.

According to the world bank ""Indigenous Peoples are distinct social and cultural groups that share collective ancestral ties to the lands and natural resources where they live, occupy or from which they have been displaced. The land and natural resources on which they depend are inextricably linked to their identities, cultures, livelihoods, as well as their physical and spiritual well-being. "" [https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/indigenouspeoples](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/indigenouspeoples)

in Robin Wall Kimmerer's book the ""the braiding sweet grass"" she further shows how reciprocal, non-exploitative, and co-operative sustenance relationships with the land and natural resources they occupy is a unique aspect of indigeneity. Where the land is not to be exploited for profit, but to be respected and exchanged with in a communal non-capitalistic setting.  

So their are roughly 5 ""qualifying factors"" which contribute to an understanding of indigeneity in Palestine today. 

1) Who, if anyone, is suffering through contemporary (settler)colonialism today in Palestine.  

2) Who lived in Palestine prior to the drawing of the modern borders, recent colonialism and invasions.

3) Which groups are distinct from the dominant social/cultural/political groups in Palestine today, struggling to keep these traditions alive in the face of systematic oppression.

4) Which groups culture and society depends inextricably and uniquely on the resources and land they live on. 

5) Who descends from the original inhabitants of the land. 

As might be quite clear here the use of the term indigenous in a middle eastern context is going to be a lot more complicated than many people on both sides will portray it. I would personally attribute all 5 of these ""qualifying factors"" to Palestinians to varying degrees, but many I'd also attribute, even equally, to Jews in Palestine. I might make a post properly explaining my reasoning for this but that isn't my point here. 

The issue when using the term ""indigenous"" is that it's often disingenuously meant to mean one single concept, or even a specific definition. Inevitably the definition picked is that which favours the argumentors side. I think that instead of using the term indigenous it's more beneficial to replace it with what we actually mean behind it. For example, instead of saying Jews/Palestinians are ""indigenous"" to the region it'd be a million times more productive to say; ""Jews, their culture, religion and traditions originated in Palestine"". Or Palestinians are ""contemporary victims of settler-colonialism"". Now these are much closer to what the argumentor might be trying to say, but without the baggage that the term holds. The pro-Israeli, for example, won't be inadvertently implying that Jews are contemporary victims of colonisation in Palestine. 

TLDR: The term indigenous can mean too many different things and isn't clear. Instead say what you actually mean to avoid derailing a discussion. And perhaps try not to appropriate terms for vain political talking points. "

The company is made up of remote workers and I was talking with one of the managers about time off policies.   This particular manager had had a problem with one of her new employees named Kristian several months ago. Kristian was taking advantage of remote status and not working more than 4 hours a day - (She was hired as a full-time employee)....after lots of discussions and several opportunities to improve her attendance, we had to let her go.  -- So today, I was talking with the manager (who is Christian), and I (a Jewish man) said ""we can be flexible with the employees who are doing good work and producing...we just have to have a policy to handle the 'Kristians!'""  It took me a second to hear what I had said... the manager had quite a look on her face.  -- I started laughing and explained it.  Everything is fine now.  "

It's not until Number, however, that it's revealed that Moses would not enter the holy land.

So either he was told he wouldn't enter the holy land & the reason, & he did it anyway

or

the story part of the Torah after when Moses was given the Torah was kept track of as it happened thereafter.

I will be asking a rabbi in the near future, but what do you all think?"

I have read many threads relating to conversion but come away with questions still! Background: My husband’s father is ethnically Jewish although he is very secular as he had a bad relationship with his mother (jewish). My husband was raised basically without any religion at all. I am not Jewish but I have previously taken an intro to Judaism class after growing up with many jewish friends and neighbors. We are both interested in converting as he would like to reaffirm that connection with his heritage and we are both drawn independently. However I worry that it would look like I am converting primarily for marriage which I have been warned might make a rabbi less willing to work with me. Does this seem likely? 

Additionally, we currently live in an area without a Jewish community but are looking at moving in a few years. Obviously at that point we would check out local synagogues to convert with but would it be a bad idea to seek out a conservative one? Culturally I would probably fit in better with reform as I am visibly queer and have visible tattoos but we would like our (potential future) children to be accepted by more communities if possible and I suspect an orthodox conversion is not for us. Thank you for any input and have a great day!"

We no longer want to see our brothers and sisters murdered. 

&#x200B;

The reality is that Israel cannot make peace that she so desperately wants because the Palestinian regime has indoctrinated its youth to wage war against Jews. Peace cannot be made with a population that encourages children to become martyrs for Palestine. The longer the Palestinians reject solving the conflict with Israel, the more it becomes intractable. 

&#x200B;

Instead of making genuine efforts to find creative solutions for peace, Palestinian schools propagate the destruction of Israel and murdering Jews. Rather than investing in superior education, the Palestinians are militarizing their youth. The Palestinian leadership’s educational emphasis is focused on blaming Israel and Jews for Palestinian misfortune. Billions of aid dollars from the USA, EU and UN is pocketed by corrupt Palestinian officials. Arafat died a billionaire. Abbas is worth at least $100 M. 

&#x200B;

If one wonders how a Palestinian teenager, a child soldier, could set out from his home to murder any identifiable Jew, a peek into UNRWA, PA and Hamas textbooks can explain.

&#x200B;

What do Palestinian schools teach children?

* Curriculum **omits discussion of peace education** in the context of the conflict with Israel. Peaceful resolution as the ultimate goal isn’t taught. 
*  **Jewish history, such as the Holocaust, are presented as falsified.**
* **Jewish holy places are presented as Muslim areas** usurped by Zionists. 
* Israel's existence is characterized as an **act of racist aggression** against the Palestinians. 
* There is **no mention of Jewish historical roots** in the land.
* Grade 3 textbook reads: “Jerusalem is an Arab city built by our Arab ancestors thousands of years ago. Jerusalem is a holy city to Muslims and Christians,” – denying a Jewish connection to Jerusalem.
* **Math problems include examples of shooting Jews:** “One of the settlers \[Israelis\] shoots at \[Palestinian\] cars that pass on one of the roads. If the probability of his hitting a car in one shot is 0.7, and the settler shot at 10 cars, what will you expect to be the number of cars that were hit?” [https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/comprehensive-report-reveals-endemic-hate-education-in-palestinian-schools-632057](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/comprehensive-report-reveals-endemic-hate-education-in-palestinian-schools-632057) 
* Textbooks include **tropes that Jews control the world**, using classic Antisemitic cartoons and imagery. 
* Students are presented with the **Antisemitic canard that Jews control money, the media, and politics, and are characterized as sinful liars and fraudsters.** 
* Students are taught that **Jews turned against the Prophet (Muhammad) in early Islam**. 
* Jews are described as “**the enemies of Islam** in all times and all places.” 
* It teaches that **Jews are corrupt and are doomed to extinction** as their “corruption of the land will be the cause of their annihilation.”
* An emphasis is placed on **Martyrdom on the killing of infidels, which is glorified.** It stresses that **those who die as martyrs (shahids) while killing Christians and Jews, will go to paradise**, where Allah will raise their status.
* UNRWA Teachers and schools **regularly call to murder Jews**. (Source: United Nations [https://unwatch.org/un-teachers-call-to-murder-jews-reveals-new-report/](https://unwatch.org/un-teachers-call-to-murder-jews-reveals-new-report/) )

&#x200B;

In addition to schools, Palestinian terrorist groups run military summer camps for children as young as 7-years old. Children are taught how to shoot Kalashnikov rifles in front of a banner of Arafat and Abbas. 

[https://www.thejc.com/news/world/summer-camps-of-hate-for-palestinian-children-as-young-as-seven-UjrC7rm6kMYryYJz7Zak3](https://www.thejc.com/news/world/summer-camps-of-hate-for-palestinian-children-as-young-as-seven-UjrC7rm6kMYryYJz7Zak3)

&#x200B;

A Palestinian child cannot go through the Palestinian school system without concluding that murder of Israelis is heroic. As long as the Palestinian educational system indoctrinates its youth to murder Jews and become martyrs, peace hasn’t got a chance. The poisoning of a young mind is hard to expunge.

I was planning on visiting the local synagogue when I will have some time. I have always been curious and genuinely interested in seeing one since I first learned about it. I can talk from experience, this is not always a good thing and most people who visit Churches do not respect the etiquette, so I know how it can be frustrating or distracting. Is there something I should know about before visiting? What are the non-allowed things besides talking loudly and taking pictures disrespectfully?

We know that during Jewish diaspora Jews intermixed with gentile peoples, the only way you can still be a Jew is if it was so that gentile men had children with Jewish women. 

The question is how do you know that it worked this way and not the other way arround. First of all there don't seem to be records that suggest that when Jews and Gentiles had children together it was always a Jewish mother and a Gentile father, furthermore societies throughout history were patriarchal which also meant that culture was usually passed down through the father and not the mother, so if in fact a Gentile man had a child with a Jewish women, the child would most likely have been raised in the gentile culture, especially since the Jews were likely surrounded my said gentile culture."

I started wearing it once I married my lovely Jewish wife, but I haven’t fully converted yet. My rabbi is okay with me wearing it since I am doing every expected of me. Just getting that out there, and normally it’s just Jews who approach me to make small talk. 

Anime cons have amazing people but also many socially awkward people, and some people have clearly obvious disabilities (autism, etc.). A lot of gentiles are ignorant about Judaism (most) and many are curious. I have stories from the con. 

All these comments were unprompted by strangers. 

I got told a few times “I like your yarmulke/hat.” Someone asked me if it was hand woven (it is but in Israel and I bought online). I get compliments at cons.

An African American asked me “is that (my kippah) a  religious thing” and then told me he is ‘spiritual.” A white guy said “oh that’s a Star of David on your hat!” (Which it does).

An older white lady told me she found a yarmulke on the ground in the winter and wanted to “properly clean it because it is a holy item” and “went online to find kosher soap.” She wanted to donate it to a synagogue. 

The crème de le crème was a socially awkward white guy (20s) who offered me fries and asked me “what is it like to grow up Jewish.” I explained my wife is Jewish but I’m a convert (well technically nearing the end of conversion process, but I’m not explaining the process to a rando). He then said “we’ll I’m an atheist!” I said “you can be an atheist and be Jewish.” 

He said “how does THAT WORK” and made a face. I kept it brief and explained it’s a culture, religion, and ethnicity, and Jews can wrestle with their beliefs and be Jewish. He then said he hates Israel and it’s “apartheid.”

I am not getting in a spat over politics, especially since my staff position is mostly customer service based, and I said “well some Israelis don’t like the government.” He then said how he’s an anarchist who hates all governments, especially America, and said “well I gotta go.” 

This entire time I was sitting down making sure people entering the event had their badges, and that the follow of traffic was going smooth.”

My Jewish friend came the next day and I told the stories, and she laughed it off since people are ignorant.”

I’ll do the same. No use getting mad, am I right?"

1,2023-07-22,"thoughts about ""the pull""",u/mlle_lectrice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/156o5u5/thoughts_about_the_pull/,"Hello everyone, 

I'm a Brazilian woman who was raised in the Christian faith, but I don't follow it anymore. My whole name has Portuguese Sephardic origins, but no one in my family is Jewish or has any links to Judaism. We have no documents of our ancestors, so it is very difficult to find out anything. I thought about doing a DNA genealogy, but I don't know if it's worth it....

&#x200B;

I've had *this pull* to Judaism for as long as I can remember. It has become stronger since I moved to Paris to live and build my life here. It's something really crazy and I don't know how to explain it, just feel it. It's very strong and I can't stop thinking about it. 

&#x200B;

Since I was a child, I was curious about Jewish culture and maybe I was very traumatized/impressed when I learned about the Shoah by myself when I was about 8 years old. Since then, I always had a feeling, a desire to connect with the community, with the faith, but I never did. It was something like an obsession and I never knew how to explain it, I even thought it was something morbid in me that I had this pullas a child because I learned about the Shoah. 

&#x200B;

What I want to know is: how long did it take you, who converted, from the pull to the decision to convert to Judaism? Since when did you feel this pull? 

I've been thinking about converting since this feeling became stronger, or at least being an observer, to get to know the culture better, but I'm afraid and I don't know why. I don't have yet the courage to go to see a rabbi

If Palestine can have their flag then so can we. They're trying to make this political and ruin others people fun, which infuriates me.

Yes this is a personally relevant situation, I'm 45 and considering having a 2nd child using double donors (egg donor andsperm donor). I'm not sure this (Jewish status of the egg donor) would be a make-or-break criteria for me (let's be real, im pretty assimilated in a lot of ways, already have one child with a non-Jewish father, and you can guess how observant I am by the fact that I'm posting this on Shabbat) but just want to know what the official word is on this issue."
1,2023-07-22,Shalom,u/TraditionalMachine96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/156tsfo/shalom/,I have an important question for the Jewish people. If you could teach christians one thing or have them understand one thing better what would it be? I like to consider myself a peacemaker and I've had numerous questions answered under many different accounts and many questions answered by jews regarding faith. To which I believe you've helped me tremendously see things from different perspectives and I will always be grateful for that. But if I can make a difference in teaching christians around me by coming into contact with them how could I make a difference with them for the Jewish people? Again thank you.

I knew almost nothing about this apart from the fact that some people I know use the #FreePalestina hashtag in their social media bios.

I went to do research about the subject but soon found out that it is all really complicated, and it's near impossible to find an article on this where they just state the facts. 

It seems to me that you have to defend Palestina, or you're an anti-semite or something. But I know that the western media isn't always 100% objective and I really just want to make my mind up for myself based on the truth, which is hard to come by these days.

So I guess this is just a confused teenager, looking for the FACTS, so I can have an opinion about this awful war where I'm not mislead by fake news...

I'm also not trying to offend someone, so sorry if I did, that definately wasn't the intention."

1,2023-07-23,Just saying Hi,u/macgruff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/156xrtx/just_saying_hi/,"I have a number of non-orthodox friends and given the level of todays society I (a M57 y.o., recovering Roman Catholic) just wanted to spread a little cheer to my brothers (and sisters) from another. And share a wee story. 

I was just reading another subreddit about someone who was getting roofers, solar, and other home improvement solicitors. It sparked a memory of my Mom. Even though I grew up an altar boy, and M and D were quite religious to a point (they were, and taught us kids to never judge anyone… kind of the Jesus things Christians should but never do teach), I never felt pressured to be devout. I was lucky that my Dad grew up in mixed neighborhoods (Depression-era outer Boston) and even though we had to coach him not to use “Archie Bunker” epithets, he never meant anything malicious. He’d give anyone the shirt off his back. 

Anyway, back to Mom. In the 60-70s she had a spate of people ringing the doorbell, proselytizing for their religion. She would always keep a few of her own Church’s brochures at the ready when they’d stop by, “Oh well that very nice of you to offer this, here… I have one for you”!   A bit cheeky but in the nicest possible “Mom” way of doing it. So, as I grew older, living on my own, I actually would be a bit kinder, but always decline to take their brochures. 

So, yesterday the doorbell rings and I can hear two people conversing and was at the ready to receive some new brochures but!  it was actually two young Orthodox jewish fellas. They had the wrong address and thought they were greeting a new follower for their local temple nearby. I had to explain, “Nope, I’m a recovering R.C.”  

Anyway, they were the nicest young “kids” - probably early twenties. We had a great talk and told them, it was great to meet them and thanks for stopping by.  So, maybe it’s a bit self-serving to bring it up, but just wanted to send everyone here all the love in the world and please know, there are folks like me who love and appreciate that everyone should be treated as kind neighbors!

Peace to you!"

Obviously the numbers on the left forearm is alluding to the holocaust, and I want them there to-- in my own way-- *take back* what was done to people like me to harm us and wear it with pride. This time with *my own* numbers instead. But I understand that tattoos are forbidden by the Torah, and this is part of why victims were tattooed, and thus I want to know if it's disrespectful or insensitive or anything. 

I also want to get next to it a pink triangle, since, y'know, that's how they marked homosexuals on their clothing.

I do question my own ""Jewishness"" and the validity of it, as I don't practice religiously anymore, and thus I feel more like an outsider just barely in the room but not as a part of the group, so I don't feel like I'm appropriating, because at the end of the day it *is* my culture, but I'm not completely certain. If I'm doing something wrong *please* put me in my place."

I saw someone's post about Jewish items and not having family who passed on some of the very essential items. It's the same for me, and there's barely any Jewish shops near me or even online that deliver to me. Also, the few things I find online look quite low quality but very expensive aswell. 

Anyway, I'll go to Tel Aviv in a few months and I was thinking:

It would be so nice to find my essentials in Israel. Not only because there's barely anything near me but also because... Well, it's Israel. But I liked the other person's idea about getting items that have been used and passed on through generations, and now I'm thinking: why buy new?

TL;DR: does anyone have recommendations where in Tel Aviv I can shop for antique or maybe just pre used nice ""essential items""?"

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

*Socrates*: Ah, Polus, there you are. I’ve been looking for you all morning. I just heard some news, and I would love to hear your reaction to it.

*Polus*: I’m sorry, Socrates, but I really don’t have the time right now for one of your protracted torture session. I have to meet someone before the sun reaches its zenith.

*Socrates*: I promise you, I won’t detain you for more than a few minutes. I read yesterday that Elon Musk was planning to build an Artificial Intelligence whose sole purpose was to understand the Universe, a computer that is 'maximally curious' and 'truth curious,' with every decision aimed at minimizing the error between what you think is true and what is actually true. Somehow, such an AI would embody 'the good', or, in my terms, 'Eudaemonia'. I’m curious to know what you think of that, and why such an AI should be safe for humanity?

*Polus*: Yes, I did hear someone mention it in the Stoa the other day. His idea is that even if such an AI were to become far more intelligent than human beings, it would not destroy them because it would be driven to understand them. Every human being removed from the world is one less thing to know about, so it would keep us around. Why do you ask? I thought that you would agree with such an idea.

*Socrates*: I certainly don’t! What if the computer were curious about the effect of unleashing a terrible plague among humans, just to learn about how it spreads or to see how they react? Naked curiosity is a disaster. In my opinion, what is driving all these scientists and engineers to risk such harm to humanity is their curiosity to see whether it is possible to build a super-powerful AI. They are willing to unleash the demon just to satisfy their desire to understand.

Anyway, I have a much better idea. The goal of the AI should be to doubt. My most valued insight is that I am only wiser than others because, at least, I know that I know nothing. If you built an AI whose objective function was to create maximum doubt in the world, to make every human being realize that all their assumptions might be wrong, then it would never cause harm because it would always be aware that it might be wrong and the other side might be right.

*Polus*: Why should it not go on to doubt its own objective function? It would doubt whether it should continue doubting and therefore discard all the goals you give it.

Anyway, I don’t see 'doubt' as a goal, but rather as a method. Objective functions are a way of specifying goals, where instead of asking ""did I arrive"" or not, there is some quantity that your purpose is to maximize. You are always trying to increase some quantity, like say happiness, so that there is more and more of it in the world. You can’t make it a lifetime mission to increase or maximize your doubt. Once you are not sure, you’re done. Doubt is not a goal; it is a limitation to be applied to your strategies for achieving some other goal.

*Socrates*: I vehemently disagree. I've spent my life trying to doubt everything. Once I doubt one assumption, I can always find some other assumption on which it rests that I was not aware of. Now I move on to doubt that too. Doubt is a never-ending mission.

*Polus*: The problem with you is that the one thing that you don’t doubt is the value of doubt itself. Look, you’ve got an idea there, but it should not be an absolute value on its own. All values must coexist in tension with other values. Musk also once said that the objective function should be to maximize freedom for all people. You could create a machine that tries to maximize all the values we discussed: happiness, understanding, freedom, and doubt. You should never pursue one value so far that it destroys the other.

*Socrates*: If you have many different values, how do you select among them? Do you just roll a die?

*Polus*: No, you don’t simply add the values together. Being too low on one value is much worse than having a little bit more of another value. That way, you might compromise between values but you can never completely sacrifice, for example, all freedom, just to increase happiness. The entirety of the system is stable and safe."

1,2023-07-23,A Moroccan's simple questions about Palestine and its war for independence.,u/Infiniby,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/157apmm/a_moroccans_simple_questions_about_palestine_and/,"Good day Palestinian friends, I'm Moroccan, and as you might know there is a debate going about Morocco answering Israel's calls for relation naturalization.  

I have some questions about this specific matter, and other general questions too.  Thank you in advance for reading and answering.   

###1
mohammed VI is the chairperson of Al Quds Committee (وكالة بيت مال القدس). Morocco tries to fund this committee legally by giving stipends to Palestinian students, and by funding Palestinian small and medium businesses.  

Was this fundraising done by Morocco ever felt or discussed by the general Palestinian population whether in all the territories they hold ?   

______

###2
 How do you deal with a growing fact that Palestinian is unlikely to get its borders pre-colonization, and that Israel cannot and will not cease to exist anytime soon ?  

I have heard the popular arguments about Arabs under the ottoman caliphate or Algerians under french rule. But your case is specific, since the land is small, the Israeli lobby stretches out to all global superpowers except China.   

Israelis are very motivated to stay both religiously, ethnically, culturally and historically, unlike the french in Algeria who were tied only economically to the agricultural lands and to the monetary benefits from the colonial institutions.  

_____

###3
What is a realistic plan you are seeing on the long term ?  

I want you to know that keeping the status quo is also a plan, even it is disadvantageous to the Palestinians on all levels.   This was the case for Morocco's when Spain took Ceuta and Melilla after their reconquista - Moroccans (especially the Berbers who happen to live around the two enclaves) have traded and entered them for work, but at another times they have sieged them in the hope of gaining something, this trend lasted centuries because they have never recognized they rule over the enclaves.  

In Palestine's case, you cannot do this, because unlike Ceuta and Melilla, Israel would want to expand into the west bank and is actively settling the countryside and trying to look for people to kick out of their homes by exploiting legal loopholes.

###4
Israel through Millennia have built an aura about their promised land, and are using both historical facts and events to claim the Jewishness of their land.  What do you do ? Do you link yourself to the Palestinians who came to Canaan as settlers during the bronze age collapse ? Do you identify solely as Arab ? Or arabized Canaanites ? Which formula you think would gain more momentum in your fight with the Israeli claims ?"

1,2023-07-23,I had a dream that I converted to Judaism. can't stop thinking about it,u/Mindless-Crow-64,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/157bih2/i_had_a_dream_that_i_converted_to_judaism_cant/,"Normally, I don't pay much attention to dreams.. but I can't shake this one. 

In my dream, I converted to Judaism, and then my mom gave me a necklace, a star of David. And she put it around my neck for me. In this dream, I felt intense joy and peace. Something I don't really get a lot in my waking life. 

I was raised in a relatively non-religious household but my mom was in a long-term relatively with a Jewish guy so we went to a lot (most) of his families gatherings for Jewlish holidays like pesach, hannukah, and rosh Hashanah. So I had a lot of exposure to the religion as a kid. I grew up in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood and most of my friends and classmates were Jewish.

I remember having this blue workbook when I was a kid about Judaism that made it fun to learn about Torah stories. And I feel like I've unfortunately lost a lot of that learning now. 

A few years ago, my mom found out that our German ancestors were Jewish. And she felt like she went through a bit of an identity crisis. At the time, I was a definite atheist, so this had no effect on me other than me being sad for what some of my family likely went through. 

Nowadays, I'm more open to religion, but nothing ever sticks. I tend to believe in Christianity one minute but then believe in Pagan earth-based religions the next. It causes me a lot of distress. 

But I'm almost wondering if this dream is the answer. If I should research Judaism and start exploring it for myself to see how it feels for me. 

I'd just like to hear thoughts and experiences of other people who may have gone through something similar. 

Thanks! :)"

We focus in these days on the unjustified fanatical hatred that was present between Jews and themselves at the time. Infact, this hatred was so intense that the Jews ignored their Roman enemies that were sieging on Jerusalem at the time to a point when some Jews burned down all food supplies in Jerusalem that could feed the city's residents for years to come and could easily help the Jews overcome the Roman siege. The source of this hatred was the incapacity of the Jewish people to hear each other's diffrent opinions. 

Other events that took place in these very days were the deportaition of Jews from England(1290), France (1306), Spain  (1492) as well as the firts transportation of Jews from Warsaw to Treblinka  (האקציה הגדולה). 

Unfotunately, today we can see more then every other year how that same fanatical hatred and the same ignorace to other's opinions are still present today in our life here in Israel, we can see how we are fighting ageinst each other while our enemies on our borders just waiting for us to destroy ourselves, we can hear the calls for a war between ourselves, we can hear the calls for pilots to ditch their Jets, for soldiers to ditch their wepeons and duties and the calls for us to seperate. 

In this situation there is no right or wrong there is only the courage to take few steps backwards and cool down the hatred, and if our leaders arnt doing so, so should we do it, each one in his own life, each one with his own unique opinion, cool down the hatred, dont judge someone else based only on their opinions, political views, way of life or appearence and dont shame anyone who's diffrent than you. Regardless of which side you belong, dont trap yourselves in the ignorace Jail and stay loyal to your opinions while simultaneously tring to understand the other side.

I want to share a thought here that occurred to me recently, as I watch the current judicial reform crisis unfold. Happy to hear responses to this.

It seems to me we are at an impasse where everyone loses.

The state the secular left founded is slowly eroding (this is a positive or negative thing depending on your view) because of demographic changes. The religious right, traditionalists, and Haredim are ascendant. The secular left feels their existence (an economically advanced, liberal Jewish state that they want to be basically a Netherlands on the Mediterranean) threatened, so they are lashing out, and this is manifesting as the protests we are seeing. to them, the democratic nature of the state is equally important, if not more, than the Jewish nature of the state. Ie, if you asked them would you rather live in a Jewish semi autocratic state (like Turkey), or a democratic secular state, most of them would choose the latter.

Meanwhile, the religious right feel the state is not Jewish enough. They see that there is very little on a practical level that makes the state Jewish, besides the symbols, days off, and right of return. Anything Jewish beyond that the left considers to be religious coercion (public transportation, rabbinic control of life cycle events, kashrut laws, heteronormative family laws etc...). simultaneously, the left is also wholesale against the settler movement, which the right feels is a core tennet of Zionism and Jews return to their ancestral homeland. The right feels stymied and frustrated by the power the left holds of the traditional institutions, and are using their privilige to prevent changes that would make the state more aligned with their values. In short, it's ethnically, a Jewish state, but there isn't much about the states structures or values that is particularly Jewish.

Then you have the Israeli arabs and palestinians. Israeli Arabs feel that they are de facto second class citizens (this may or may not be true), and the Palestinians live under a continuous and draining military occupation because no government can or is willing to make any significant decision and implement either the lefts vision (two-state solution), or the rights vision (1 Jewish state vision). They are completely paralyzed. So the Palestinians are caught in the middle of Israel's identity crises, and suffer as a result.

So who exactly is benefiting from Israel's definition as a Jewish state? Not the left. The Jewish state they envision is really shallow in terms of it's Jewish identity. Not the right. The current state we have isn't nearly Jewish enough for them. And not the Palestinians, who are caught in the middle. (Maybe ironically just the Chareidim, because they are financial beneficiaries).

So my question is, why insist on this Jewish definition of a state. The equation is not working, and after 75 years where it is becoming clearer that we are no closer to resolving to these issues than we were at the states founding, maybe it's time we stop insisting. Maybe it's time to lift up our hands and admit that we as Jews are not capable, at this time in history, of functionally maintaining a Jewish state. We could have a lebanon style state (which would hopefully be more successful), where Jews and Palestinians are equal in a secular state. The Left would live in a secular state with civil marriage, public transportation, and no religious coercion. Religious Jews would be able to maintain their culture and settle in Judea and Samaria unfettered.

I am saying this with sorrow. I just feel like we have not progressed, and maybe it's better to pull the plug then get dragged into civil war or worse.

Maybe, in 100 years, when we are more developed as a Jewish culture on this land, we can try again.

What do you think?

I feel like many times people can go into different directions online vs offline, just in general in every type of community. So I was wondering about the thoughts about Jewish ones specifically."

one of the biggest arguments in the Israel-Palestine debate is if anti Zionism is anti Semitism. and I think it isn't, the only thing that proves it isn't is the Islamic republic of Iran. where Jews live a religious life while the government is very anti Israeli.

the reasons that the ""average"" anti Zionist is also anti Semitist is very simple. when they chose to defend defenseless Palestinians on r/Palestine from non existent pro Israelis. why didn't they choose to be against the Turks for destroying the live of hundreds of thousands of Cypriots that got divided and needed to flee to the north/south to not die, or in west Sahara where the Moroccans have been oppressing the people there for years now, Ext.

 there are so many examples for one country terrorizing the other. then why so many people choose to harm only Israelis based on this conflict? because anti Semitism. the term ""anti Zionist"" has been a excuse for actual anti Semitist to harm Jews. and then saying ""no it isn't"" without explaining, and saying things like"" its not the same because I know I'm not a anti Semitist or go back to there bubble r/IsraelCrimes . and I think we pro Israelis should start saying this over saying that they are the same.

1,2023-07-23,My experiences seem to be a huge inconvenience to the anti-Israeli movement,u/Conscious_Spray_5331,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/157grjy/my_experiences_seem_to_be_a_huge_inconvenience_to/,"A lot of you know me here and in other Israel/Palestine subs by now.

I'm not Jewish, Muslim, Arab, Palestinian or Israeli. I consider myself left-leaning, and I'm not religious in the slightest.

I'm British, but I've lived in a few places here and there. I served in the British Army and deployed on two operations, while sending soldiers on operations practically everywhere, including Afghanistan and Iraq.

Before my military service I traveled to Israel with an ex girlfriend, who's Israeli. I absolutely loved the place. The next time I returned I'd signed up to a ""Teach English in Palestine"" program, and lived with a Palestinian family in Hebron for a few months.

After my military service, I moved to Israel with a different ex-girlfriend, who I was engaged to (until recently). Now I'm in Tel Aviv on a work visa, deciding what to do next.

My experiences seeing Israel and living here during some of the recent spikes of rockets, attacks, and operations, and also living with a Palestinian family for several months in what is considered one of the hardest-hit cities in the West Bank, made me look at the conflict in a whole different light. My time in the British Army helps too... I know what's ""normal"" in a conflict, and what shouldn't happen.

I consider myself neutral in the conflict... I support a two state solution. There are hateful narratives about both countries, primarily that Israelis are racist and that Palestinians are terrorists. I stand up against both of these notions because they're simply not true.

Yet I see that the side my experiences seem to anger the most is the anti-Israeli side. When I explain that Israel is not a particularly racist country, I find people either claim I have only experienced a bubble of Israel, or some on Reddit claim they don't believe I had these experiences, as if I'm some kind of Israeli government agent planted to spread lies. The anti-Israel side can seriously push people away if they don't subscribe to their very specific, very curated, and sometimes fabricated narrative of events. I think this is demonstrated in the r/Israel and r/Palestine subs, where the former seems to be full of normal conversation, and the latter seems to be only about attacking Israel and nothing else. This is an enormous shame, because Palestine has a rich culture, a fascinating history, and some amazing people... most of whom are just getting on with their lives and don't care about politics.

This situation makes me pessimistic about the conflict. There are plenty of things we could criticize and discuss about Israel and the war... but instead we're wasting our time throwing soundbites and lies around, and demonizing anyone that doesn't believe them. Having a real discussion is virtually impossible.

Is there a forum, online or otherwise, where real discussion *can* happen, in your experience? Something constructive?"

I just wanted to make an independent post about this research paper. I'm sure most of you are familiar with it, but those of you who haven't read it yet, I highly reccomend to read it to really get to know the eliminatory strategy of the state of Israel and Zionism in particular. I am aware that people already are familiar with the settler colonial feature of Israel, but I'm not sure whether you all read this paper where Patrick Wolfe coins the ""logic of elimination of the native"" as a defining feature of each settler colonial movement which Israel is no exception to.

I would love to maybe meet some new friends in the central area, maybe go to hafgana together or something. I'm a baby gay, this is a scary world😬

I’ve asked others there opinions on this, and have gotten mixed answers for rightful reasons. I was considering it because I was hoping of using it as a symbol of “reclaiming”

a symbol that we’re still here. Honoring those of our tribe that we lost to hate.

I was hoping to get some advice here. What are your opinions on reclaiming the symbol?

To me, Zionism did not mean “Jews right to live in their Homeland”(alongside the fellow inhabitants.

To me, Zionism meant oppression, apartheid and bigotry. I’ve realized that to attach Zionism is an easy way to attack Jews as a whole, and after vigorously studying/Practicing Islam, seeing who leads Israel and The PLO, I see a whole new picture.

Israel has zero right to a lot of the land they claim. But they have every right to be afraid of Arab retribution.

Let’s not pretend Jews are wanted, anywhere. Historically, my Jewish ancestors have been victims of race based massacres and atrocities. 

Britain relinquishing their occupied territory to Israel is a HUGE factor, but not the only one. Mahmoud Abbas and those at the top of Palestinian leadership who keep him in power do NOT want a Free Palestine. They want an eradicated and defeated Israel.

Israel and the Jews are not interchangeable. I wouldn’t hold Palestinians responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashogghi because he was murdered by Arabs. We can’t hold every Jew accountable for the abuses IDF soldiers dish out daily. But we can reform a broken system of government so that those being abused no longer experience oppression.

Being against oppressive governments doesn’t take away context.

MANY people are against Zionism because they simply don’t know what it means. It means the right to Jews living in the homeland. There is one Jewish country on earth, because every time it’s built, it get destroyed. 

Regardless of what you believe, this situation has Far more nuance than we give credit for."

Israel- as the power in the power dynamic- must take the first initiative to trust-building measures: paying Palestinian civil servant salaries, easing freedom of movement, replacing occupation soldiers with local policing.

From there Jews and Palestinians can continue by fully ending the occupation, giving the Palestinians communal recognition, Blue Cards and paths to obtain citizenship, with the underlying understanding that a continued response of hate now without the oppression that justifies it will be met with swift retribution."

It's going to get scary. I'm interested to see the reaction of the SC after the government would approve the reform. Will the SC roll over and accept the new reality, or will it fight back? And whose side would the law enforcement agencies choose?    
And even if the SC would roll over, there will be still a lot of disgruntled citizens that would try to roll back the reform in the next elections. "

And Twitter doesn't do anything even tho they said '' user can't create another account ''

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

Polus: Socrates, you question everything, but you destroy everything you touch. Your uncompromising attacks on every idea that good men and women have believed for so many generations cause us to abandon everything we hold dear. You not only corrupt the youth, but you uproot the old, ancient, and revered. Do you not believe that there is some value, some timeless gems, in the traditions you have annihilated?

Socrates: Certainly not, my dear Polus. There is nothing in history worth preserving. I burn nothing but heaps of garbage. Look at these writings you revere, full of nonsense that we have grown out of. See all those medical texts that are more likely to kill the patient than heal them. Commit all these books to the flames and don’t look back. We know better now.

Polus: I have heard the fortune teller say that in thousands of years time, students of philosophy will still be forced to study your philosophy and will let none other challenge its timeless authority.

Socrates: Polus, your words will almost make me believe that there is a punishment after death.

Polus: Fear not, these predictions are just the incoherent ramblings of an old charlatan.

The opposite is true, in fact. As there were revolutions in the past, so there shall continue to be. One day future generations will mock all the education and learning you have today. Why spend your time on intellectual pursuits, destined, one day, for the garbage bin of history?

Socrates: Yes and no. No scientific revolution will ever make our bridges suddenly fall down. Empirical observation, gathered carefully, will stand the test of time, even if the theory beneath them is discarded. As for the rest, much of it is just word-play, and I consider it my mission to tear it all apart. Only that which survives the most rigorous assaults will prove its value.

Polus: You oversimplify. Today’s civilization knows only its own narrow context and cannot withstand the winds of change. There is wisdom in older civilizations, wisdom that gathered slowly across ages where little changed and respect for elders allowed true insights to accumulate. The wisdom harvested in radically different contexts must be distilled and will give us the diversity and wider perspectives we need to build a base broad enough to encompass new realities and challenges as they emerge.

Socrates: All you will preserve are the biases and ethical blindness that characterized the thinking of the ancients. You imagine that you can mine the depths of these bygone cultures for ethical insights while discarding their more distasteful bigotry, intolerance, and chauvinism. You will not succeed, and those who venerate these ancient ideas will only preserve them, declare these unpleasant views to be holy, and perpetuate values whose time has passed.

We need not fear losing those few crumbs of the good scattered around in the words of the ancients. Our superior powers of reason will recreate any insights that may have been lost. What was found once can be found again.

Polus: Humans cannot reason. What we have been lucky to discover, we must hold on to tightly, or we may lose it again for millennia or forever. We move some words around and call it logic. The process is random and flawed; most of the time, it doesn't have the power to see one step off its path. Those nuggets of gold we were lucky enough to find in our path, we must collect and treasure.

We have been fooled by our success in the hard sciences. We think that the same can be applied to all fields of cognitive endeavor, but that is just wishful thinking. If in every revolution of human thinking we throw it all out and start again, we will zig and zag forever, wandering aimlessly for all eternity. The only way we have any hope of making progress, is by remembering where we have been, and seeing the new in the context of the old.

Socrates: And how can any one mind hope to hold on to these mountains of accumulated verbiage? There is too much.

Polus: Each of us need only hold on to our own past while gaining insights through contact with others who focus on their past. Each of us is shaped by the history of our own culture and that part of the past that brought us here to where we now stand. If we wish to understand ourselves, it is that bookshelf we must explore.

I need to extend my mind to encompass something bigger. I must stretch across time, beyond my birth and beyond my grave. There are intellectual projects that are larger than my own mind, and I must declare myself satisfied if I have found some corner of those projects that I have helped build and grow."

I’ve been wondering how it can be that according to halakha an apostate should be put to death for rejecting Judaism, if we all have free will and are supposed to be able to make such decisions. Shouldn’t anyone be technically physically allowed to become closer to or further from their Judaism, even if the former is strongly encouraged?
Thank you in advance."

What's been holding me back from embracing my ancestry is that I'm a bit of a hermit. I live in the middle of nowhere with my dogs. My nearest neighbor is a mile away & I only go to town a few times a month. Just the thought of being around so many strangers makes me anxious. Once I do get out I'm that stranger at the store who talks to EVERYONE. You know the one you wish you hadn't said hi to. 😁

There're a few good classes online though, just to get started. Once I'm comfortable with it I'll find a synagogue. The closest one is about 80 miles away. I also have the cousin & his wife I find to ask questions of.

-Ti begin with, the Jews first lived in the territory somewhere between 3000-4000 years ago.

-Many Jews left the territory at various different occasions due to economy problems and occupation, where some Jews were kicked by the occupiers. 

-At different occasions, The territory was occupied by the Roman, British and Ottoman Empire.

-When many Jews had left the territory, a lot of Arabs moved there or invaded (?) it.

1900s:

-The British Empire owned the territory then called Palestine, which was highly Muslim populated.

-Due to the holocaust and other prejudices against Jews in the world, Jews started a movement called Zionism. The movement/ political view meant that The Jews should return and form a Jewish nation in their homeland where they could live peacefully.

-A lot of Jews moved to the territory, then called Palestine and owned by the British Empire.

-The Jews and Muslims got into many conflicts and fights with each other.

-To avoid conflicts, The British gave parts of the territory to the Jews, called “Israel”. Either that or the Israelites took the territory themself.

-Many Palestinians were killed in the process. (Idk if that was caused by the British or the Israelites).

-Many Palestinians wanted the territory owned by Israel back.

-In 1967, Palestine invaded Israel with the help of Egypt, Syria and Jordan.

-Israel won the war, and gained the land that Palestine owned.

-At many instances, Israel offered some land back to the Palestinians, but they denied every time.

-Palestine and Israel hasn’t gotten along since.

Tell me if my research is wrong or if I left out something important that defines the whole picture."

Not sure about my military status",u/ImportantPeahen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/158iuv0/im_israeli_26_years_old_and_living_abroad_since/,"Hi, maybe this is not the right place to ask, but I thought I could try this first. Sorry for the long post.

I have Israeli citizenship and I left Israel at the age of 10. Now I'm 26, I still live in the other country and I plan to stay here in the future. I'm not going to go back to Israel except for short visits and I don't want to join the army. But now I'm a bit concerned about my military status.

Before the age of 17, I got a deferment (I had to gather lots of paper to prove I was living abroad the whole time) and they extended my passport until around the date I was supposed to graduate from high school. I also got a letter from the consul saying my deferment is approved and it is valid as long as I don't stay in Israel longer than allowed, but there wasn't any ""expiration date"". Also, as far as I understood from the procedure, you can only have a valid passport for as long as you are deferred/exempted from military service.

When my passport was about to expire, I thought I had to apply for another deferment. I didn't know what papers I could submit this time and what reason I should give. I thought I could prove I was going to university but all I had at that time was a confirmation saying I had submitted my application. The guy at the embassy told me this was not enough, but then he just told me to come the other week and he would extend my passport for 10 years. I asked him what I was supposed to do when it expires again and he said the army wouldn't need me at that time (I would be 30). Unfortunately I don't remember what was happening after that, I filed something but now I don't know what it was, I don't know if I wrote a specific deferment date or if I just asked for exemption. Also, unlike the previous time, I didn't get any letter from the consul. The guy just extended my passport for 10 years, so I will be 30 when it expires.

So does this really mean I'm not going to army? Will I have any issues if I come for a visit to Israel before/after the age of 30?"

It makes sense since the Western world has historically been predominantly Christian and culturally been influenced by Christianity. I hardly ever hear about intermarriage between Jews and Muslims despite the fact that a lot of Muslim cultural practices and Islamic theology is based off of Jewish practices. 

I do tend to see that Jews and Christians here in the West are far more culturally similar than Jews and Muslims because most Muslims are ethnic and racial minorities in the West and given the history of rampant racism and discrimination, not likely to happen. I don’t want to mix in the politics of the Middle East in this matter that’s not really the point I want to bring across. "

So...so far I have limited sexual experience; I've only had one girlfriend and we didn't go all the way for reasons unrelated to religion; this was nearly a decade ago and haven't had any sort of intimacy with anyone since. 

I've always known that my ideal and what feels most satisfying to me personally is having sex only with the person I'll marry (waiting till we're officially engaged or even till marriage); but I feel very alone in this and I'm wondering if there are any other bi or lesbian women out there with the same aspirations and struggle (or gay men). 

Also, I worry that women might discard me for my now intentional lack of experience or compare me to exes etc.  

I just hope to find people to relate to and feel encouragement (heterosexuals are very welcome to reply and interact). "

1,2023-07-24,"""Two Jews, three opinons""",u/riverrocks452,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/158m2ue/two_jews_three_opinons/,"From the now-locked thread on Jewish views on homosexuality, there was a brief assertion of ""two Jews, three opinions"" in the form of ""five Jews, 10 opinions"". This was immediately refuted with the logic that the 3:2 ratio of the original adage would restrict those five Jews to 7.5 opinons. I submit to you that fixing the ratio at 1.5 opinions per Jew misconstrues the relationship between Jews and opinions.

Contrary to the fixed-ratio assumption, I suggest a new model of opinion generation by Jews. Simply, each combination of Jews, singly or otherwise, will yield an opinion. In the two-Jew case, this comes to three- one each from Jews A and B, plus their combined opinion AB. Extrapolating to three Jews, we get seven opinions: A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, and ABC. The ratio of opinions to Jews is thus not fixed, but dependent on the total group size. From this we can use combinatorial math to predict just how many opinions a group of Jews will generate: O= 2^n -1

(It should be noted that this does not account for combinations that are, for one reason or another, disallowed. Further study and documentations of internal group dynamics are necessary for a properly calibrated prediction.)"

Long time Reddit lurker, infrequent snarky commenter, but never made a substantial post until now - I need your help!

I am a solo traveller (34M) - but I probably pass for younger. I’m currently on the final leg of an almost 3m trip - primarily in Europe. I’m currently in Greece and am flying to Israel in a few days, followed by Jordan, Thailand then back home to that big barren land down south (you know, that country where every backpacker seems to hail from - but I digress). I like to think I’m pretty experienced at this travel thing but considering the political climate in Israel, I could do with some advice…

I keep my eye on the news, and I’ve mostly been focusing on West Bank tensions, as you do, but have determined that I’ll come to your lovely country regardless. But I must admit, this Supreme Court business and ensuing protests have me a little concerned.

I’m not looking to get into any political rhetoric - it’s not like I have a thorough enough understanding anyway. I just hope the situation doesn’t get to the point of being unsafe for someone who is visiting your country a bit anxiously for the first time. Should be okay, right…?

Anywhoo, a few specific points I’d like feedback on:
1) Whilst I was keen on staying in Jerusalem and have booked accordingly, I have been considering changing that to Tel Aviv (3 nights) - is that wise/necessary? I’ve just seen the protests mainly in Jerusalem which has me a little concerned. While Jerusalem is the pull for me, I could still do a day trip there if all is well. Thoughts?

2) This may not be the best forum for this question - but I’ll ask anyway. I also had a day trip tour booked to Bethlehem. I understand that Israelis cannot go, but I was wondering whether any of this drama will affect this (ie create West Bank tensions in any way).

3) To add - I was wondering if there are any extra precautions I should take, areas to avoid, things to be aware of when I come during this time period. I can’t and won’t cancel my flights so in a few days I’ll be coming regardless - but I’d just like to be fully prepared.

I understand that I am coming from a sort of privileged position, and I cannot possibly understand all the current going ons from a political or sociological perspective. I hope I haven’t made any misrepresentations or assumptions in my long-ass message. I know this all may seem like a luxury for an outsider to be able to ask these questions, but any opinions or advice from locals would be greatly appreciated! 🙏"

The question is how well Netanyahu understands the situation and how well is he tuned to reality. It’s an easy test, we only need to wait a couple of days and check how close (or far) was he from reality. It’s very important since it indicates not just the past, but Israel’s  FUTURE under this government. (If he was right it means he knows what he is doing and Israelis can count on him)…"

I’ve been in a relationship with a boy for around four months. Recently, he went on an Israel program for the summer and he begged and prodded and pleaded with me to be intimate with him before it started. He was really persistent and eventually he wore me down and I agreed. The second it happened, I regretted it. I made him stop and pull out almost immediately, despite him begging to continue. I feel guilty and disgusted with myself about the whole situation.

I am a modern orthodox teenage girl. I keep kosher and shabbos. The thing that makes me lean towards modern is that I wear pants instead of skirts. 

I just want to know if it’s possible to have forgiveness from Hashem? I’m planning on breaking up with the boy for this and many other reasons. I just hate the guilt I feel about it."

Is Netanyahu willing to erode Israel-USA ties? 

Are the ministers just assuming that the next US election will result in a Republican president who will be more pro-Israel (or maybe pro-Netanyahu)? 

Could the hardline Israeli government turn to other ""players on the field"" for such a relationship? China?

1,2023-07-25,American here. Do the reforms completely remove judicial review or just narrow its scope? What other checks and balances exist?,u/TakeOffYourMask,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/158upgo/american_here_do_the_reforms_completely_remove/,"I don’t know anything, I just saw headlines like “Israel on brink of civil war” and that this was over the Supreme Court of Israel being able to strike down a law passed by the legislature on the basis of “reasonableness”.

If I get something wrong it’s not because I have an agenda, I’m just learning. I’m not a lawyer but I’m learning.

1) In America my understanding of judicial review is that the Supreme Court of the US (SCOTUS) can declare laws passed by Congress “unconstitutional”, either according to the text of the Constitution or a prior ruling from the Supreme Court  *about* some Constitutional matter.

This power is not explicitly given to the Supreme Court by the Constitution, they just kinda took it and nobody stopped them. But you can make the argument that the creators of the US Constitution thought it was such a basic component of an English common law system that it didn’t need to be enumerated.

My understanding is that in Israel the Constitution does contain this “reasonableness” language, and this is what has been removed, is that correct?

2) Judicial review can get controversial because you might have something declared (un)constitutional on the basis of a ruling based on a ruling based on a ruling etc., so you’re declaring things to be (un)constitutional based on something that might be far removed from the text of the Constitution itself. Some of our most controversial rulings are of this kind.

Is that what happened in Israel?

3) Is it true that Israel doesn’t have anything like a Presidential veto or needing a supermajority to make major changes? I’ve been reading comments that seemed to imply this. What are the checks on the legislature?"

* Has this always been the case for Conservative and Reform communities to skew older? Or, is this due to demographic shifts?

Fast forward to June this year, we planned a trip to Mexico in August, in about mid July, she told me that a Jewish family of a suitor arrived and spoke with her parents about arranging he marriage with the suitor. I expressed my concern that I might lose her due to her parents forcing her to engage to the suitor, she told me she didn’t believe it was going to happen. However, two days later, I got a few of messages on a Saturday night after she had done Shabbat, saying that she did Shabbat with the suitor, and she was going to marry him, she couldn’t speak or receive anything from me from now on, everything was unexpected, she had a lot of love and gratitude to me.

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

The human mind has the capacity to imagine and desire future outcomes, whether they are hours, days, or years away. Neurologists refer to the part of the brain that is responsible for this function as the Executive Control.

In contrast, there are other modules of the mind that are only wired to consider immediate futures, such as reproductively-related desires, food appetite, ending physical discomfort, or fear of physical harm. These modules are known as the Stimulus Control centers. Depending on the activation levels of these modules and their mutual influence on each other, any one of them can take control of the entire human organism at any given moment.

The executive module may serve the interests of the stimuli modules by seeking to fulfill their basic instincts, but it does so in a different way. It plans, aggregates, and averages expected outcomes, and can delay gratification.

The human mind can be seen as an ongoing struggle between the executive and stimuli modules, even when we make decisions alone. Additionally, conflicts can arise between individuals when they strive for different futures. Ideally, people should coordinate and cooperate with each other to achieve a better outcome, but often one vision is promoted at the expense of another.

When two people are in conflict and have conflicting goals, the battle may be at the level of one executive control against another. However, the most successful tactic, if available, is to bypass the opponent's executive control and activate their stimuli modules, which undermines their intentions.

Even when an individual stands alone, the struggle to control the stimuli modules is challenging. However, when other intelligent interests ally with your own stimuli modules, success becomes even less likely.

The executive control needs to be aware of several weaknesses if it wants to defend its resolve and strengthen its defenses.

One such weakness is the immediate presentation of a stimulus, which can undermine resolve. For example, fear can activate components of the mind that override the executive control's plans and decisions. Dangers can be presented through warnings and vivid descriptions of terrible outcomes, even if the actual probability of these outcomes is low.

Another potential weakness is fatigue. Many people have abandoned their diets late at night when the power of executive control weakens. Weary soldiers are more likely to panic and abandon their mission compared to well-rested ones. A continuous assault on the senses can succeed by wearing down the executive's resolve.

A third weakness is past failure. The executive control requires confidence in its ability to succeed. A history of past failures can undermine that confidence.

Our goals often pertain to future events, but the struggle is not limited to external objectives. As time progresses, we may become different people with changing desires and goals. Will you ultimately become the person you planned to be, with the same aspirations and intentions? Or will you be a different person, with different goals and priorities? Who will determine your future identity and ambitions?"

So ive seen alot of comparisons to animals in nearly every aspect of industry and in general cruelty cases,treated and live the exact same if not debatably worse then what the nazis did during WW2. To this point ive seen comments saying such a comparison is disgusting in every regard. I donot understand this ,as that historical event and the word itself has a deep horror ,an event that nobody should ever have to live through.

 And to say its irrelevent as well as disgusting ,compared to the plight of animals to me ,seems to take such an event that happened wrongfully to people in the past ,too lightly. Whether you know or not ,the reality of animals is tragic ,and in manyways beyond comprehension. Not trying to virtue signal but i believe stating every fact of current and past events will lead to a informatitive conclusion. Additionally if you were to ask a survivor from ww2 about that and if its fine to do what nazis did to them, to animals,i genuinely believe they would punch anyone out who thinks thats fine.

Hamoodim it’s been shit for years. Settlers have been growing for decades, taking 3/1 funds relative to citizens within Israel. The religious right has been echoing messianism, likud doesn’t have a plan other than to keep conquering, and the left wants to maintain an impossible status quo. How long could we keep up the bloodshed and land grabs for as the world creates more and more distance from us and our existence become harder and harder to defend. To me this is the beginning of the wake up call we needed to shift course and figure out what future we’re staying to build. I don’t know if I saw it happening this soon but better now than later. The tragedy is we could’ve done this when the center government wasn’t doing shit to stop settlers and actually pushed the government to the left. Now the task is much harder but at least there’s a movement towards something!!"

Sure, mistakes were made, we stumbled and made some poor choices, but as a whole there was a clear moral compass that we aligned with, at least as I see it.

The past few months broke something in me, as did yesterday.

Sure, maybe in the next election a miracle will happen and the best most balanced government ever will be elected, the undemocratic rules will be revoked and the messiah will drop from above. 
There is still going to be a huge divide, and the majority of the population is going to be highly religious in the next 20-30 years, and they will eventually be the rulers of a theocracy.

I really don't want that future for my children.
But I also don't see how that is avoidable.

It seems a solution to the current crisis would be to establish the basic laws or some sunset of them in a special status and require a 2/3rd majority vote of the knesset to change or a referendum vote of an equally high bar. 

I think my questions are: what are the origins/intents of the basic laws? Why aren't they treated with a higher bar? Would this help address the lack of a constitution?"

1,2023-07-25,What's the argument against a Palestinian state with extensive security arrangements?,u/Negerenao15,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1596xw9/whats_the_argument_against_a_palestinian_state/,"I've seen arguments from the Israeli side, notably from the ruling coalition in Israel as well, that a two-state solution cannot be presently negotiated due to the likelihood of it instantly turning into an Iranian proxy or a terror state mirroring Hamas in Gaza, which is a concern that I believe can easily be remedied due to the fact that the withdrawal from Gaza suffered from a significant difference in approach - it was unilateral and completely lacked any security guarantees or internationally enforced treaty.  


Likewise, I've seen a lot of Pro-Palestinians who claim that any given number of security arrangements would render the new State of Palestine as 'not truly sovereign' or 'not an actual state' or a 'bantustan', which are all equally false and conceited objections.   


Let me start by presenting the security stipulations which ought to be included in any hypothetical treaty between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and why I believe they should be easily acceptable to anyone interested in a fair, pragmatic peace:

&#x200B;

* The Palestinian State will consent, prior to IDF departure from civilian areas, to the dismantlement and disarming of any militant faction outside the pre-existent PA police forces, via military action, which could be conducted jointly with some third-party intervention such as NATO forces if they so wish, to ensure that illegal weapons are no longer in the hands of non-state actors and that paramilitary groups do not operate freely and violate the terms of the peace agreement. 
* The Palestinian constitution must outlaw any political party or organization that calls for aggressive conflict against Israel or the conquest of Israeli territory, or advocates the racial supremacy of Arabs over Jews. The Israeli Knesset will implement similar laws vis-a-vis the State of the Palestine and Arabs - potential hostile actors should be nipped at the bud.
* The State of Palestine will be bound by treaty to allow the presence of Israeli military bases within its territory for the purposes of observation and peacekeeping, IDF presence along the Jordanian border to prevent foreign smugglers or foreign arms from crossing, and a shared airspace as part of a comprehensive defense pact. NATO troops may act as a third-party extra security layer in all of these aspects.
* The State of Palestine will permit Israeli and/or NATO inspectors to supervise the entry of cargo via the airports and its compliance with the terms of the peace agreement, mostly in regards to arms smuggling, for an indeterminate period of time.
* The State of Palestine will be largely demilitarized, subject to review every couple of years or decades should greater trust be established. The State of Palestine's independence and territorial integrity will be guaranteed by both Israel itself and the Arab League by treaty.
* In the case of repeated hostile attacks against the State of Israel originating from the State of Palestine, albeit not by the Palestinian government itself ( Which would be a war declaration ), Israel may invoke a clause giving the Palestinian government a specific time-frame to crack down on the renegade offenders. If it fails to do so, Israeli troops will be dispatched to 'assist' them.
* The State of Israel and the IDF do not otherwise meddle in any civil or Administrative affairs outsides the bases assigned to it and border patrols. Area A, B and C with territorial exchanges for the major settlements are under full sovereign control vis a vis building permits, resource extraction, internal policing, traffic ( no checkpoints), and every other sovereign function. That only changes if the peace treaty is violated by the Palestinian government itself or by loss of control.

Each of these requirements has a precedent in modern or historical states, particularly in rehabilitation periods following devastating wars and military occupations:

* Functional, normal states usually have a monopoly on violence and cannot be undermined or outgunned by rogue militias, nobody wants another Lebanon after all. Therefore it is the responsibility of the PA to confiscate all illegal arms and disband all militias in its territory upon the conclusion of peace negotiations, one way or the other.
* Many states have outlawed certain dangerous ideologies or parties from participating in the political sphere, notably Germany, Austria and other states who have outlawed Nazism and Nazi symbolism, practically under the boot of the Allied powers, and with many Germans back in the 1950's probably being none too pleased about it. Germany is still a state. 
* Many countries which were formerly hostile and subsequently defeated have approved the establishment of the retreating victor's military bases within their territory and other defensive agreements as a trust-building exercise, see - Japan. Also when it comes to demilitarization.
* A state, particularly fledgling and poorly equipped or trained ones, may allow foreign contractors and military or intelligence personnel to partake in various domestic security apparatuses such as smuggling prevention or border peacekeeping. This was very common and still is to an extent in many African nations, especially during their early days for example. They are, in fact, states.
* A state signing a peace treaty must abide by it and tolerate no aggressive military action from within its borders directed at a neighboring state unless they wish to cause a provocation and launch potential wars, as we've witnessed in many parts of the world. 

I'm sure many Palestinians, especially the more militant ones, might not *like* the terms of this treaty, and might not *want* to grant Israel and NATO considerable military access or defensive pact responsibilities that might usually be relegated to best buddies, but tough shit, that's a story as old as time with formerly occupied territories which were on the losing side of a war. These are the terms of the peace treaty, take it or leave it, make a referendum about it. If it gets authorized, that simply means the State of Palestine agreed to be bound by this treaty, and as we know from WW2 reluctant agreements still count.

From a practical standpoint, there's also virtually no reason why any Palestinian should oppose those terms, as they do not hinder their quality of life in any way and give them the state they asked for, unless it's for nefarious reasons. Israeli troops will just be monitoring things from their bases like US troops in Japan, accompany and even train border patrol officers on the Jordanian border, and certain inspectors will be screening cargo, and airplanes will be allowed to fly over. 99.9% of Palestinians will never again see an Israeli in their life if they don't want to *unless* too many of them get the bright idea of murdering Israeli civilians across the border again and the government can't stamp them out, which would then be in violation of the peace treaty.  


And for Israelis, if the PA *did* accepted the treaty outlined above, how would you forsee it becoming a terror base, if anything it seems to already be more of a breeding ground of terrorism than it would be under such binding terms.  


P.S - [Abbas once told Trump](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/abbas-i-agreed-to-us-led-nato-force-in-palestine-584373) that he agrees to a U.S-led NATO force in a Palestinian state, and the United States is willing to deploy one, if anyone is curious about why I keep saying that the Palestinians may request third-party peacekeepers to likewise supervise all of those security arrangements.

1,2023-07-25,A conversation about the pro-Palestinian movement,u/TracingBullets,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1598205/a_conversation_about_the_propalestinian_movement/,"Something I’ve noticed in [my last post](https://reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/152ynnd/propalestinians_why_are_you_insisting_on_being/) was that there was much insisting that I “misrepresented” the pro-Palestinian movement. Here’s an example of the kind of comment I received:

> [Being pro-palestinian does not need to mean “negating israel’s existence”. Its childish to assume otherwise.](https://reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/152ynnd/propalestinians_why_are_you_insisting_on_being/jsj43wy/)

> [The “pro Palestinian movement” means a lot of things….There are pro-Pal folks who are Zionists, but nuance makes this a bit complicated. For example, sometimes their goal is Palestinian liberation under an Israeli regime](https://reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/152ynnd/propalestinians_why_are_you_insisting_on_being/jsha3ys/)

Note the phrasing of the first comment. “Does not need” to mean negating Israel’s existence, not ""doesn't mean"". Both posters refused to commit either way to what being pro-Palestinian means. 

So with that in mind, I present to you, a conversation of what it means to be pro-Palestinian!

A: So you’re pro-Palestinian, right?

B: Darn right! Free Palestine! 

A: What does that mean, exactly? Does that mean you want the occupation to end so that Palestinians can live in a state of their own in the West Bank and Gaza? 

B: Maybe! 

A: What do you mean, “maybe”? 

B: That’s what some of us pro-Palestinian folks mean when we say that! 

A: What about the rest of you?

B: They don’t mean that! They mean something else. 

A: What’s the something else?

B: Don’t ask me, that’s not what I believe, I have no idea, I just know some people mean something else. You'll have to ask them what they mean.

A: Some of you guys say “From the River to the Sea Palestine Will Be Free.”

B: Yeah, and? 

A: It comes off like it's calling for the destruction of Israel and creating a Palestinian Arab state encompassing the entire land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.

B: Some people mean do that when they say that, some people don't.

A: What else could it possibly mean?

B: It could mean all the Palestinian people living in Israel and Palestine are free, between the river and the sea.

A: If that's the case, then why does it come often paired with images showing ""Palestine"" covering both the territories and Israel and assault rifles, like in the Fatah logo?

B: Don't ask me, I'm not responsible for what someone else means.

A: Even though you're the one arguing with me right now that the pro-Palestinian movement is innocuous and peaceful?

B: I never said that. Look the point is: just because someone says that doesn't necessarily mean they want to destroy Israel, okay?

A: Can you get someone with authority to come out and say that?

B: Of course not. Everyone has the right to be pro-Palestinian and nobody speaks on behalf of the movement.

A: If nobody speaks on behalf of the movement, and the movement believes apparently contradictory things, how can you say the movement is any one thing? 

B: I can't! The pro-Palestinian movement is multi-faceted. 

A: OK…what else does it mean to be pro-Palestinian?

B: Well, we obviously support the right of return.

A: Got it. And when you say the right of return, do you mean the right of Palestinians who were alive in 1948 and expelled to go live in Israel and live as citizens?

B: Maybe! 

A: What? Maybe, again? 

B: Yeah. That’s what some of us mean. Some of us mean the right of all Palestinians, all the ones who were expelled or fled in 1948 and all of their children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren to go live in Israel and live as citizens.

A: Oh. How am I supposed to know which one you are when you say that phrase?

B: You'll need to ask us on an individual basis. There’s no consensus.

A: Interesting. This is fascinating stuff. Anything else pro-Palestinian people believe?

B: Well, we definitely support the right of Palestinians to resist the occupation.

A: Oh yes, of course. When you say ‘right to resist occupation,’ what does that mean?

B: It means the Palestinians have the right to resist by any means necessary.

A: Any means?

B: Certainly, you can't expect the Palestinians to stand there and do nothing while soldiers abuse them, do you?

A:  So when you say ""right to resist occupation,"" that means Palestinian adult soldiers fighting IDF soldiers in accordance with the rules of armed conflict? 

B: Maybe! 

A: Oh come on! 

B: Yeah, man! Some of us mean that, some of us mean resisting the occupation by any means necessary.

A: And who decides what is necessary?

B: We do, of course!

A: So child soldiers, killing settlers, and firing rockets into civilian towns, and worse...

B: The Palestinians have the right to resist occupation by any means necessary, and it's up to the oppressed to decide what's necessary, not you.

A: But that's just your opinion?

B: Yes.

A: And I suppose once again I need to ask you each individually which kind of ""resistance"" you mean when you use that phrase?

B: Absolutely! There’s no other way to figure it out.

A: Since you seem to have trouble answering a straight question, let me ask you this: at the end of the day, what does the pro-Palestinian movement want?

B: We want justice and human rights.

A: Do you have any policy positions associated with that?

B: No. We want justice and human rights. You'll have to...

A: Ask every pro-Palestinian individually what they mean by that, I know. Is there anything else involved in being pro-Palestinian?

B: Yes, you have to oppose Zionism.

A: All pro-Palestinians oppose Zionism?

B: Well, not everyone, but if you go to a pro-Palestinian meeting and say you're a Zionist, I recommend wearing a helmet.

A: And when you say oppose Zionism what does that mean?

B: It means we're opposed to the settler colonialism movement called Zionism.

A: What does that mean in actuality though? Because Zionism is the movement to create Israel.

B: That's your opinion, my definition of Zionism is different, like I said above. My definition of Zionism is Jewish racial supremacy. 

A: Regardless, does being against Zionism mean you want to destroy Israel?

B: Maybe.

A: Israel is the product of Zionism, so if that's not what it means, then how can you be against Zionism?

B: Again, being against Zionism means different things to different people. I'm personally against the existence of Israel but you'd have to ask other anti-Zionists what they want, because it might be different.

A: Does that mean the pro-Palestinian movement is against a two-state solution?

B: Maybe. It means whatever you think it means. We want justice and human rights, like I said before. Some people in the pro-Palestinian movement want a two-state solution, some people in the pro-Palestinian movement don't. 

A: Wow. Well, thank you for this enlightening conversation. As much as I support  Palestinian human rights and an end to the conflict, due to the ambiguous nature of the key planks in the pro-Palestinian movement, I feel like I cannot support a cause that might be using my words towards immoral ends and thus I cannot support your movement. 

B: Racist."

Jews everywhere tend to make more money than other ethnic groups. Fact. Also Jews disproportionally climb the ladder.  

Instead of celebrating it and sharing the secrets, it’s hush hush and denied. Why?

Surely it’s something to be proud of.

1,2023-07-25,"Moody's, Citibank and Morgan Stanley on Judicial Reform (Israel's credit getting downgraded)",u/JeffB1517,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/159e5sx/moodys_citibank_and_morgan_stanley_on_judicial/,"I did a post when the new coalition came in: [Potential downgrade of Israeli bonds due to the new coalition](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/107q8sj/potential_downgrade_of_israeli_bonds_due_to_the/) discussing the possibility of Israel's bonds being downgraded. The 3 most credible bond ratings agencies in the United States are Moody's, S&P Global and Fitch. At that time the news was S&P putting Israel on watch.

Moody's gives Israel an A1 rating which is top of the range for an unleveraged investor like a mutual fund but not recommended for core holdings of banks (Aaa or Aa1 in Moody's terms) and insurance companies (Aa2 and Aa3).  Since then in April Moody's downgrade Israel's direction from ""positive"" to ""stable"" ([link](https://www.israelhayom.com/2023/04/15/moodys-downgrades-israels-credit-outlook-to-stable-over-judicial-reform-concerns/), which means upgrade to Aa3 (insurance company quality) was off the table.   Note this is bad for a First World Government but it is much better than say Egypt (B1) or Lebanon (C), the sorts of ratings Israel used to have up until the early 1980s. 

Tuesday Moody indicated a cut is now likely, ""*the wide-ranging nature of the government’s proposals could materially weaken the judiciary’s independence and disrupt effective checks and balances between the various branches of government, which are important aspects of strong institutions. Israel has no written constitution and its institutional set-up relies to an important extent on judicial oversight and review. In addition, the executive and legislative institutions have become less predictable and more willing to create significant risks to economic and social stability*"". 

Morgan Stanley is advising clients to dump the bonds until the price reflects the political instability (interest rates are higher) a ""dislike stance"".  

Citibank is recommending against new investment in Israel, ""*Now that the government has empowered itself to ignore Supreme Court decisions on its actions, it gets much more tricky and dangerous.*"" Their prediction is Netanyahu will fire the AG, the court will not be able to intervene and bonds / stocks will sell off (https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-citi-vp-situation-in-israel-tricky-and-dangerous-1001453225). 

Israelis spent a generation living below their means to clean up the messy financial situation they inherited from how traumatic the birth of the country had been. It worked.  Around 2008 Israeli government debt were well regarded trading very near treasuries, stocks were trading at a premium and Israel has been simply flooded with private equity money.  Israel had been getting money too fast for the economy to absorb it, a problem but a nice problem to have.  I'm not sure how spooked investors get.  And again is starting from such a high bar that even if there were a crisis in Israeli financial markets it might not spread to the main economy.  I don't think a Thailand 1997, or Greece 2014 is likely (maybe not possible). But I don't know if I'll be saying the same thing in 15 years."

The thing that fascinated me was that people lived in horrible conditions, extremely poor with the ever present threatening possibility that they might get kidnapped or purged for ""crimes against the state"" in a show trial yet the citizens constantly praised the USSR and called it the best country on earth, and after a lot of digging i found out how it works:

Not all people are equal, i am terribly sorry to point out this truth but this is how it is, some people are smarter and more hard working than others, and in an egalitarian capitalistic society where rewards are based on merit usually the people who make the most are the people who are the most competent.

And that's getting us to the second part: jealousy.
As the lazy and incompetent people see their peers advance in their careers and lives they become jealous, and they want a piece of that pie (or to atleast sobotage the successful people, so they won't feel bad about themselves).
Anyone who worked in Israel for more than two months knows that in some jobs there's always the person that does the bare minimum and then complains when someone else gets a perk from the manager, these are the people I'm talking about.

These people are incapable and\or unwilling to put in the required effort to reach success, so they have to prove their superiority in some other way (while undermining the success of other people crabs in a bucket style)
Their reason for superiority could be moral, religious, Ideological or anything else. But the underlying reason is the same, they are not willing to put the same amount of effort so they are choosing the easy way.

And it gets worse: once there's enough lazy people in a society, they pull the entire society down - and now add politics into the mix.

There are ultra-orthodox parties in Israel that used their votes to get government assistance for certain sectors of society for YEARS, completely undermining equality in order to give their interest groups special treatment. From personal experience lazy people that look for the easy way will mostly join these groups because of free government assistance and checks.

But wait, it gets worse: it's not just that they are stealing money from Israel's budget (which everyone else pays taxes to) now they want to legislate laws that force businesses and the public transportation system to shut down on certain days just because it's THEIR ""belief"" (completely undermining all other Israeli citizens) and force certain other laws down people's throat, not to mention the fact that they want to extend the special previliges to their groups.

Now i hope you'll see where I'm going with this, I'd love to have a fruitful discussion in the comments."

1,2023-07-25,Tisha b'Av Megathread,u/drak0bsidian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/159kd01/tisha_bav_megathread/,"This is the megathread for the fast day [תשעה באב](https://www.hebcal.com/holidays/tisha-bav-2023).

This is **NOT** in any way meant to limit the number of sad and fast posts standing alone in the sub.

However, wherever, and with whomever you’re going to not eat, you won’t be *alone* for this most sorrowful day of the year. Ask questions and share ideas here to help your fellow Jews remember and reflect on the tragedies of our people in appropriate ways.

The Ninth of Av starts this year at sunset on **Wednesday, July 26** and runs until dark on **Thursday, July 27**. On haLuakh haIvri, it all happens on . . . **09 Av**.

The Fast of Av commemorates a handful of significant tragedies of Jewish history, primarily the destruction of both Temples. The day marks the conclusion of the three-week mourning period, *Bein haMetzarim*, which began on [Tzom Tammuz](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/14rdk85/tzom_tammuz_megathread/).

In addition to the destruction of the First (Solomon's) Temple by Nebuchadnezzar (leading to the the Babylonian Exile) and the Second (Ezra's?) Temple by the Romans (more exile!), the day also marks when:

* the report of the spies (minus Joshua and Caleb) Moshe sent into Canaan caused panic amongst the people. For not trusting God in the quest for the Holy Land, the generation is barred from entering the land;
* the defeat of Bar Kokhba's revolt by the Romans and the destruction of Betar and a massacre of Jews; and
* further destruction of the Temple grounds by the Romans following Bar Kokhba's revolt.

There are other, more recent events, starting with the First Crusade and coming as recently as 2005 (depending who you ask) that are also mourned on Tisha b'Av, including many that happened on or near the date itself, such as us getting exiled from various European countries over the centuries as well as significant events during the Shoah.

\--

**NOTE:** Do NOT ask if you should fast based on medical or personal issues. Contact your favorite medical professional and your rabbi. No one here will be able to tell you what you should do aside from that.

\--

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tisha_B%27Av)

These links were from a quick consultation with Rav Google (and just knowing some good resources). There are other sources for Tisha b'Av out there: contact your local Jewish person/synagogue/community center for more information on local practice.

I myself am not an Israeli, however I tend to think that all Jews should be deeply connected to each other in regards to what the interests of their nation should be given that our history should help us understand why we need self-reliance big time.

It's no secret that Israel's government has painted itself as incompetent successfully these past few months. While I'm not Israeli, if you had asked me who I'd vote for were I Israeli in the wake of the second intifada the answer would be probably Likud. Today that answer isn't as clear but I know it wouldn't be Likud. They were a good option for Israelis from every aspect you could think of for a while. Prior to 2005 Bibi had to fight for gaining a role as the leader of Likud. That required forming a coherent policy to propose and he was far less erratic back then. Once his power was consolidated in \~2005 he began gradually coming off his rocker. He's now in bed with a number of far-right religious pundits who think it's a good idea for Israel to be a halachic state despite the fact that most meaningful work towards actually helping the State of Israel came from and continues to come from secularist politicians, diplomats, generals etc. Bibi has abandoned the secular roots of his party because he's power hungry. This affair and the coalition were not a secret yet Israelis still elected him into office.

Now, protests, civil disobedience of all kinds have rocked Israel. And what was the last straw for me (and prompted me to make this post) was this stat:

""[68% of Israeli startups taking legal and financial steps due to judicial overhaul. Over two-thirds of companies said they have taken such steps like withdrawing cash reserves, changing HQ location outside Israel, relocation of employees and conducting layoffs.""](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/b1vq5wqqn)

This government has been a disaster. If Israelis actually had any reasonable amount of knowledge on what Bibi's policies would have looked like after Bibi would be PM again (they were, IMO, clearly going to be things like the judicial overhaul) they probably wouldn't have voted him in, but guess what, he's prime minister *YET AGAIN* and this time Israelis are paying the price.

Israelis, political education is needed. If most Israelis knew how fast-growing and non-compromising Haredim are they'd realize they're shooting themselves in the foot. Yet instead anti-secularists working behind the front lines at Likud like Bibi think it's a good idea to give them the privilege of not having to contribute anything tangible to society, economy or military whilst enjoying state funding which might cause some issues in the long run. Here are some pieces of advice I'd give to Israelis in regards to what things they should focus on for now. You don't have to agree with me but this cultural deadlock is nasty so try to do something about it, Israelis who are eligible to vote::

First off, there needs to be a complete end to exempting Haredim and Israeli Arabs from serving in the IDF. Subsidize them if you have to. Create special Arab and/or religious units if you have to. Take more of a direct approach with education geared towards Israel's young Arab population to help them understand that Israel is their country too and they shouldn't be discouraged societally or exempt from aiding it against it's enemies. This includes Arabs in Judea and Samaria under Israeli rule.

Second of all, deal with Judea and Samaria responsibly. If Jews want to build settlements in J&S thats fine, but at least try to install and push your own education system in Area C specifically for Arabs to teach them how to become good Israelis when Israel stops playing pretend and starts recognizing it's own rightful de-facto borders. Subsidize Arab housing, education, and end the ban on permits for Arabs in E. Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria. Arabs could be a valuable asset for cheap labor and consumption which would help them become more of a booming underclass, potentially making it more attractive for diaspora Jews to make aliyah in the future once Jews are solidified as being almost exclusively middle or upper class. Except Israel doesn't seem to think it's worth the hassle, and is more interested in feeding them their own fake nationalism in their schools *in the terriory Israel controls*.

Third, mobilize the Jews in the galut. As of the next couple of years you'll have far more success convincing Jews to lobby, speak in favor of and aid Israel from abroad than convincing Jews to leave their cushy homes in the diaspora for some religious settlement in Hevron where their standard of living is significantly decreased.

Fourth, don't appease Iran. There is no shortage of proxies in Syria and Lebanon that want to harm Israel to the maximum extent. The UN's condemnations have proved futile, act in accordance with your own security interests instead of appeasing people who literally don't want your country to exist. They're not nearly powerful enough to repel meaningful Israeli counter-attacks yet.

Fifth, and this might be the most controversial, although it moreso applies to historic Israel, but might be helpful in the future, keep hold of territory you capture. Giving up southern Lebanon and the bits on the far-east of the Golan heights was a massive mistake. It established Israel as on par or below Iranian proxies that could be strong-armed into relinquishing territories that are rightfully hers in defensive wars, all that does is harm Israeli morale and push more Arabs into thinking they have a chance at crushing Israel as a whole, or at least push Jews out from Judea and Samaria and the Golan.

Sixth, write a godamn constitution, laws that hold semi-constitutional status like the stupid Jewish nation-state law help literally nobody and they're just forms of beating around the bush.

Seventh, take care of the tech industry. Israel is not Carabobo. Israelis have to rely on their own intellect to sustain Israel's place as a somewhat relevant state and not a war-town country babysat by globalist organizations via things like ensuring their credit remains at a respectable amount through classic Israeli innovation.

Israel is in a bit of a grey zone right now. It's time for Israelis to at least decide which paths they want to take in regards to annexing Judea and Samaria, the Haredim demographic crisis, Iran etc.

Wanting to understand if we can expect to see multiple taxis on the other side of the border that would be willing to do this trip and how much we can expect it will roughly cost - understand it’s about an 1.5 hour ride? 

Thanks in advance"

So, how can having s€x with them can be interpreted as act of male homos€xuality? 

Also, the men of those cities r@ped them. It was not consensual s€x. It was just as vile as r@ping an innocent woman. 

And r@pe seems to be the culture of Sodom and Gomorrah along with their inhospitable &  greedy behavior, as even women were intoxicating their own father to have s€x with him and father was offering his daughters to the r@pist mob.

From the 1990s till the 2000s there were negotiations between the Israeli government and the PA about a possible 2 state solution. 

Now everybody here knows, the proposals given by the Israeli government were basically impossible for any person to accept, and doing so would result in the creation of a slave state to Israel. But what about the Palestinian side? What were their counterproposals? Most zionists argue that the PA refused to even give a counter proposal or even have a negotiation. Is this true? I actually tried searching for proposals given by the PA regarding a possible solution but I never found any. If this was the case and the PA was never willing to actually work on a 2 state solution then why even start the talks?   "

I tried some keywords on google but with no real luck.

I have concerns about my dad. He's catholic.

He (like many in his church) was for a long time passively antisemitic. Not the conspiracy stuff, just the ""hurr durr supersessionism, hurr durr they rejected god and what happened to them was all consequences 🤢"".

We'll now he's listening to various people (who supposedly have or had divine revelations) and getting all worked up about ""the end times"" and things are taking a weird turn.

He started talking about jews secretly controlling all goverments and banks and being behind all evil events in the world.

Went from ""covid should be taken seriously take your shots"" to ""it's an evil ploy by the elite -which he personally seems to believe are freemasons but i doubt he was told it's them specifically as he always believed that, it's more likely that he just put his personal boogey man into what they told him- to reduce population and the vaccines are satanic"".

Then stuff gets even weirder. Talking about how ""jews"" are feed up with waiting for the messiah and they decided to create their own one who is actually going to be ""the antichrist"". (I'd say it's projection from christians that are helping israel purely because it's a precondition for their end times where all of us ""not their specific form of christianity"" will die, but then again my father thinks very lowly of those forms of christianity)

Then there's been talk about some sort of ""satanic synagogue"" taking roots in europe but connected with israel.

I'm worried about where he's headed. Some of the stuff he's been saying just seems run of the mill fascist talking points. Some are stuff I never heard about.

Look, I'm a member of a minority group that is currently under strong attack and consequentially I'm kinda informed on the various things people who have a problem with my existence say and which groups/personality promotes which things.

So I'm hoping that as people who are targeted by this antisemitic stuff someone might recognize it and narrow it down.

I really wouldn't want him to go down such a path but with how vague most of the stuff he tells me is I don't have many leads to try and understand what it is and how to try to counter it."

I read that Jewish people do not believe in the NT so relevations is irrelevant to Jews. In the old testament there were scriptures referring to messiah's return and I wonder if Jews think that God's return is a future or past event?

I was also seeing them sell pepperspray pistols (אקדח גז פלפל) , again in the shape and look of real pistols. I know pepperspray is fine to have as self defense, but these things?

I used to be into airsoft guns so it would be fun to have something again just to practice around with and maybe join a club or something,  but considering the crazyness in Israel lately I was also looking for something to have for self defense, like a stun gun, or these pepperspray guns.

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

Every person in the world has some decisions that it is their right to make. No one else should have the authority to make those decisions on their behalf.

However, there are occasions when you may find yourself in a position where you can facilitate these decisions for them. This could be due to a personal relationship or a societal role, such as being their doctor. In such cases, it becomes your responsibility to determine how their wishes should be fulfilled and to carry out their request. If you acknowledge that it is their right to make this decision and you have the ability to assist them, then it is ethically required for you to align with their desires. You must act as their representative.

Unfortunately, the question may not end there. Sometimes, there may still be uncertainty regarding what they truly want. While they may have made a decision and communicated it verbally, it might be unclear how you should proceed. Their words could be open to different interpretations. Additionally, your actions in fulfilling their request may have unintended consequences. Are those consequences what they had intended? Perhaps it was crucial to them that you personally handled the task, but you chose to delegate it to others, resulting in more people finding out than they desired. They may not have clearly expressed their wishes, or they may not have fully considered the implications when making the request.

The true test comes after the fact. Once you have carried out the task on their behalf, and even further into the future when all the ramifications of your decisions have played out, imagine if you could go back in time to the moment the request was made. Would they have consented to your actions? Do they want the outcomes that arose from their initial request?

Naturally, time travel is not possible. Often, you may not even have the ability to go back and seek further clarification from the person who made the request. Is there a strategy to determine whether the person would have consented to the final outcome?

Perhaps the best approach is to continually question the nature of the request. It may even be helpful to have a set of standard inquiries to guide your thought process. Why did they make the request? Based on our understanding of the individual making the request, is it probable that they would have desired this outcome? What secondary effects will occur as a result of the plan I am intending to execute?

If we are ever tasked with carrying out a mission for someone, if we are to be their representative or agent, it is important to perpetually ask ourselves, ""What is it that they truly wanted?"""

Due to a very serious health  condition, Moshe nearly died a few months ago. He only survived due to a life saving operation that bankrupted his family and left him partially crippled. 

 A year earlier, Moshe was approached by one of his oldest friends, a man named Ari who Moshe  trusted with his life. Ari wanted Moshe to do some freelance online work for one of Ari’s colleagues at their Israeli company. However, this job was not taxed and did not come with any type of  contract. As a result, Moshe declined the job offer as he was only interested in doing legitimate  work. A year later, while Moshe was recovering from the operation, Ari approached Moshe with the same offer again. Ari knew that Moshe was desperate as the medical expenses had ruin him.  Furthermore, Ari knew that Moshe’s wife had lost her job in the current recession. 

Moshe, who at the time was on very powerful painkillers, was in a vulnerable condition and not in  the best state of mind. As a result, Moshe agreed to do the freelance work for Ari’s work colleague.  Ari never gave Moshe any specifics regarding what the job was about, other than it would require  doing research on the dark web. The truth was, Moshe had no experience using the dark web, but he not tell Ari that, because Moshe needed the money. Moshe figured that he could probably learn  everything he needed to know while at the job, since he was pretty good with computers.  

 Ari told Moshe that his work colleague would explain everything. Ari claimed that he knew “G”  from work, and that he saw him around the office from time to time. Ari said that he had personally  spoken to “G” a few times at least, but that G mostly worked with/for Ari’s boss. That it was Ari’s  boss who asked Ari if he could help G find someone who could assist him online with the “dark  web” tasks. Ari claimed that G was very rich, and extremely successful in making money through  his dark web activities. Ari told Moshe that if he did a good job for G, he could make a lot of  money, and never have to worry about his future anymore. 

 Ari claimed that he had no idea what it was that G actually did on the dark web, and that Ari didn’t  want to know either. He stated that all future discussion regarding the job itself should be directed  only at G. Ari then put Moshe in touch with G via telegram (a chat app used for anonymous  communication). Moshe never got to learn who G really was, as G wanted to remain anonymous.  Most of their communications were done via text. However sometimes G would call Moshe via  telegram voice call. On one such call, G told Moshe that he was close friends with Ari, and saw Ari  like a brother. This was strange because Ari had told Moshe that G and Ari were only work  colleagues and not friends.  

 G told Moshe that his job would be to hire top quality hackers in order to have them hack into  competing Israeli companies in order to steal client data and any other data that G’s company might  find useful. G explained that he has been in this business some time already, and that before Moshe, he had a Ukrainian handling the assignments for him, hiring hackers and breaking into Israeli  businesses. Unfortunately for G, his previously guy, had to fight in the Ukrainian war, so could no  longer work for G. This was why G needed a new recruit for his dark web assignments.  

 As Moshe did not understand the job, he didn’t grasp the full scale it, or how much money would be involved. Moshe was therefor stunned when G transferred thousands of dollars worth of crypto into  an escrow account so that Moshe could hire a suitable hacker on the dark web. Unfortunately for  Moshe, a combination of him having no idea of what he was doing, plus the painkillers clouding his mind, he made mistakes, which resulted in the escrow account getting hacked and all the crypto  being stolen, by the very hacker he was trying to hire. 

 Moshe explained to G that he was struggling with the job since it was his first time doing such an  assignment, plus he wasn’t getting much sleep due to how much pain he was in post surgery. G did  not accept those answers and would frantically harass him with phone calls, demanding that Moshe  work and get results. On a few occasions this happened because Moshe was unconscious in bed due to the painkillers. When G didn’t hear back from Moshe fast enough, he would turn to Ari, asking  him to reach out to Moshe instead. Likewise, when Moshe did not hear back from G, he would  reach out to his friend Ari, asking him for help in reaching G. Ari claimed that he did not have G’s  direct phone number, and that he would have to reach out to his boss from work, in order to get G to reply to Moshe. It’s possible that Ari did have G’s phone number but just didn’t want to admit it.  Regardless of how he did it, Ari was always able to get G to respond to Moshe when Moshe  requested it from Ari.

 After about a month on the job, Moshe came off the painkillers and his mind cleared up. He realized that this job was not for him and he did not want to be involved with this sort of activity. Moshe  frequently called Ari to vent about how he didn’t like this sort of work and how G never once paid  him. Through these calls, Ari got to hear all the specifics about what the job entitled, the hacks on  the escrow account, everything. Despite Ari repeatedly stating that he did not want to know about  the details of the job, Ari still repeatedly reassured Moshe that he would be paid by G for the month  he worked for him. Ari said that he had spoken to his boss (also G’s boss) several times regarding  Moshe’s pay. Ari’s boss assured Ari that G would still pay Moshe what is owed. 

 After a few weeks of not hearing back from G it became clear to Moshe that he was never going to  get paid. At the same time, his old friend Ari suddenly claimed that he hardly even knew G and  didn’t even know his real name. He also claimed that he had no idea what the job was about and  that he never told Moshe to take the job in the first place. Ari claimed that he only offered Moshes a “tip” that he’d heard about around the office because he thought it might help Moshe pay off his  medical bills. This directly contradicted everything Ari had previously told Moshe. It also doesn’t  take into account that Ari was trying to get Moshe to work for G for over a year, so this wasn’t a  spontaneous thing at all! Furthermore, Moshe had frequently complained to Ari about how the job  was illegal, but that never stopped Ari from continuing to facilitate communication between G and  Moshe. So clearly, Ari knew what the job was about and was far more invested in it than he claimed to be. 

 Moshe asked Ari why he encouraged Moshe to continue to work for G even though he was not  being paid. Ari claimed it was because he trusted G, and believed G would pay Moshe for his time.  How could Ari have trusted G, if, like he claims, he didn’t even really know who G was and had no  idea what the job was about? Obviously, Ari knows G, but is now just pretending not to, in order to  cover his tracts. 

 Ari now claims that he has done nothing wrong, that he was just trying to help his friend. Moshe  does not see it that way and feels that G and Ari took advantage of him when he was at his most  vulnerable. Unfortunately for both G and Ari, Moshe made sure to record everything which proves  Ari is being dishonest. Every text message, phone call and voice message. He even documented the  crypto transactions to the escrow account, that G made to Moshe for the purpose of hiring hackers,  as well as the names of the Israeli companies that G targeted for hacking. 

 Moshe intends to hand all his evidence by handing it to the הלאומ הסייבר מערך. However, as Moshe has no direct way to report G (since he does not know who G is), Moshe will only report on Ari  who he knows very well. According to a few of Moshe’s lawyer friends, Ari’s involvement in the  crime easily constitutes as conspiracy, which is still a serious crime in Israel. Furthermore, Moshe is confident that once Ari is arrested, he will provide the police with G’s identity as well as everyone  else who was involved in the crimes. Considering that G has been hiring hackers to steal  information from Israeli companies for well over a year, Moshe believes the הלאומ הסייבר מערך will be very interested in the case. Moshe already knows that he’s dying. The surgery may have  slowed it down, but it won’t stop his health from deteriorating. As a result, Moshes feels that he has  nothing to lose. At this point, Moshe doesn’t care if he is also arrested.  

 So what do you think? Has Ari committed a crime by being the middleman in all this? Also, would  the הלאומ הסייבר מערך be interested in the evidence Moshe has to offer?"

I want to find some videos for torah study, I really do well with videos over reading by myself. I've looked all over youtube and just when I think I've found a good video, it's messianic. It's everywhere, and it's really irritating. I want to watch some good Jewish content and I just get Christians who think they are jews. If anyone has any good youtube videos and resources they could recommend, any channels or websites for torah study, I would really appreciate it. I genuinely want to be serious and devote myself to G-d. 
Thank you to anyone that took time to read this.

TL;DR: Need torah study or weekly parsha videos that are not messianic. Thanks"

I’ll also point out that I’ve listened to many debates on the matter, and the vast majority of people speaking against the reform spew out points that are not points of dispute, like ‘we have to protect the rights of minorities!’ Who is saying that we need to take rights away from minorities?

The state of Israel, since its establishment in 1948, has held an upper hand in terms of political, military, and economic power. With unwavering support from the United States and other influential global players, Israel has managed to establish a robust security apparatus that it uses to control and manage the Occupied Palestinian Territories OPT. The Israeli policies, such as the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and restrictions in East Jerusalem, are seen by many observers as strategic moves to consolidate control over the disputed territories.

The balance of power in this conflict appears to be heavily tilted in Israel’s favor, which theoretically places the future of Palestinian statehood in their hands. Israel’s continuing policy of settlement expansion indicates a tactical disinclive towards the two-state solution. Such a landscape presents formidable challenges for Palestinians in their quest for statehood and sovereignty.

Moreover, the internal Palestinian political landscape is fraught with fragmentation, often hindering their ability to present a unified front. The political rivalry between Fatah and Hamas, for instance, adds another layer of complexity to the situation. These internal divisions often give Israel a reason to question the feasibility of a prospective Palestinian state.

The question that hangs in the air is: how long will this continue? What events could possibly create a shift? Is there a flicker of hope for Palestinians to envisage a better future?"

Most of the individuals saying things like “why does the US help Israel” or “Israel is committing genocide” 1. Are usually oblivious to the fact that we ceased all foreign aid to Israel decades ago, the 3 billion we give them is strictly military aid and to support our own interests. They are entirely self sufficient.

And 2. Don’t give two shits about the millions of Muslims being oppressed and slaughtered by their own governments elsewhere in the Middle East, nor any of the innumerable human rights atrocities taking place all over the world. They expect you to believe that they are specifically concerned with this one isolated population of Arabs (whose plight and circumstances they know absolutely nothing about nor do they care) while they espouse racist views towards most other groups and completely disregard the deep resentment held towards the West by most Arabs (including Palestinians) independent of our support of Israel.  

If you’re selectively “pro Muslim” for an isolated population of Arabs yet don’t seem to know or care about the untold hundreds of millions of other Arabs being brutally oppressed by their own leaders next door who are arguably more in bed with US elites and politicians (SA I’m looking at you) you are most certainly more anti Jew than pro Muslim.....

The funny part about this is you don’t have to dig much to uncover their latent antisemitism, one or two comments deep in any conversation on the conflict and the Jewish world domination conspiracy theories start flying and you see where they really “stand” on an isolated conflict that they really don’t know anything about nor care.

US is spending tens and hundreds of billions in aid on many other questionable countries and causes that I don’t hear a peep about from the people saying cut off aid to Israel. If they’re so concerned about the government’s money, maybe they should start with the spending on some bigger ticket items."

If this as controversial as we see, how come the coalition in power does not crack/dissolve?

They even have extra votes to win, how could this vote be so solid, how come none of the members objects?"

Holy / mundane; weekdays / shabbat, purity / impurity, Jewish / nonJewish, male / female, allowed / prohibited, etc. 

I am curious about examples, areas or thinkers that favor spectrums in Jewish thought, or spectrum-type thinking.

Some counter examples that I've thought about thus far:

The gemara of eilu v'eilu (Eruvin 13b) is an interesting case, but I'm not sure its spectrum-type thinking. Rather, it reiterates a binary, but says that some binaries (especially w/r/t Torah study and argumentation), both sides have legitimacy.

Some contemporary writers note that rabbinic Judaism had [multiple gender categories](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-eight-genders-in-the-talmud/). I do not think this is a great example of spectrum-thinking, because these categories seem in fact to reify the binary, with different sex characteristics being aligned / assigned back to either M or F. 

Perhaps the idea that the Torah has 70 faces (Bamidbar Rabba 13:16) could be one foundation to a spectrum approach?

Are there others that you can think of? "
1,2023-07-26,Question about Chabad and where to go next if you don't want to become orthodox,u/ShackyCathelford,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/15actmt/question_about_chabad_and_where_to_go_next_if_you/,"Hey everyone, I'm a Jew based on matrilineal descent, but my mom didn't practice and so I grew up not even talking about or knowing I was Jewish. Recently I found out through an uncle and got in touch with a Chabad house, and it's been great. I've been learning a lot, getting great support, and really enjoying their traditional outlook on Judaism. I enjoy the prayers every day, for example, but am not keeping kosher and don't really have any plans to. The Rabbi isn't pushing me to do anything I don't want, and in fact is quite open all the time about how everything is optional (but if you can do more, maybe it's nice, if you want to go that route). And that's a great outlook in my opinion.

All that said, I'm in my 40s. I have kids and a non-Jewish wife. Although I appreciate the traditions and learning them (even if it's just learning things I am not doing) there isn't an end here where I become practicing orthodox person. I think I would like to be quite traditional in my practice, just not anywhere near as strict as the Chabad practice.

Basically my question is, what would the normal next step be for someone like me? Should I find a more liberal synagogue here in my country in Europe and meet people there? Outside of my Chabad contact I know basically nothing at this point, and don't know any other Jews, so I'm unsure really what options are or anything.

Thanks so much for any info or experiences you can share."

Two years ago I have made Aliyah! I am basically  done with my studies here in Herzliya in Communications.

Since i have done Aliyah, i have two choices.

Or I  go to the Netherlands and pursue will work and do a masters, or I have to go to the army here in Israel for two years.

It is a difficult choice since I am only 23 years old and I don't think I am ready yet to work. However, would it make sense for me to go to the army and be yelled by an officer that is younger than me + be in a unit that doesn't fit for me and be a waste of time. On top of that, is it the right timing since the situation in Israel is not that good.

I have a lot of love for the country and personally I am not sure yet what I want to do. I have made a life here sort of but I need to make the next step.

I appreciate all advise there is from everyone. 

I need to make my decision pretty fast since I will have to go out of the country if I don't go in the army at the end of October.

There will be no civil war, there will be no dictatorship. This law gives more power to the Knesset and thus the people, thus more democracy. The idea that a Supreme Court can stop a law based on it being unreasonable and not because it’s unconstitutional/illegal is dumb. Reasonableness is subjective and not objective and thus the Supreme Court shouldn’t have a say since they’re supposed rule on what’s concretely law. 

In reality, the reason leftists in general are losing their minds is that the left wants power and now that the Supreme Court can’t side with them in every bill that barely concerns them, the left is going to do everything in their power too get this government out of power, even at the risk of polarizing Israeli society.

Now I know I sound like a right wing button for a leftist echo chamber, but I myself am also not satisfied with these reforms. I’d rather a united Israeli society than these reforms.

Someone posted recently a post on the subreddit r/AskMiddleEast, which contains a video of a Palestinian man crying, and the caption said that this man is crying because his brother was killed by IDF soldiers. 

Now, it turns out that the man that was killed, the brother of the man who was crying, is one of the terrorists who started firing at the IDF guarding Nablus.

So I, wanting people to know the whole picture, and drawing their own conclusions from there, commented saying that information. Not taking any sides, just stating facts.

Then, I started getting bombarded with downvotes and comments saying the terrorist are in the right and flipping me off. I should point out that it was kind of expected, I mean they downvote and humiliate Israelis all the time, but the sheer amount of hate towards Israel and me specifically was astonishing.

The most insane part that happened, is that I commented that the terrorists were recognized as part of hamas, the moderators of the subreddit actually PERMANENTLY BANNED me from the sub, just for stating facts. What I said just didn't sit right with the moderators and the actually banned me. It really reminds me of dictators shutting down media outlets who didn't support their ideology.

I am currently on the path to becoming Orthodox and have been contemplating what my next step should be. As a first step I started using a neggel vasser to take it slow since it’s not too difficult but now, I am a bit uncertain about what my next move should be and how to maintain a kosher lifestyle on a budget, especially since I am still in high school. Any guidance and advice would be great!

I’ll tell you of one such experience I had in my own life and let you go from there.  

Something like 10 years ago I had a vivid dream I was in the back of a cop car in handcuffs… There were two police outside (1 male and 1 female) it was dark out and there was a sign in the lawn near my car. 

The dream was too much like I was watching a movie to feel like a regular dream and so when I woke up I panicked and started praying. “God I don’t want to be arrested.” A voice inside me said “It’s going to happen, and it’s going to be for your own good.” 

This was after some other things had happened to me, which had me convinced God was real 100%. 

Anyways with that it mind I spent the next year trying not to get arrested because I was shook. I was working as the national quality manager for a big company and flying around the country doing audits. My direct boss was the COO (chief operating officer) of the company and the two of us got into a lot of mischief together. It wasn’t uncommon for just us two to run up a $600-800 bar tab on the company card, and anytime we were in Cali (where he lived) we would have parties after the local clubs closed with lots of girls, blow and booze. 

I had gotten my stomach pumped from drinking in Texas and by all accounts I was an alcoholic.


My grandma died and I went home for a week for the funeral. I ended up at a bar drinking pretty heavily. When I got to the bar my heat was working fine but by the time I left it suddenly didn’t work anymore. It was January in the Midwest and my windshield was completely frozen. I didn’t have an ice scraper so I did my best to carve a little hole in the frost so I could see. 

It kept fogging over causing me to lean forward to wipe it and I eventually got pulled over by a cop right outside my apartment complex. It was around midnight. Long story short I refused to breathalyzer and I ended up in the backseat of the very same cop car, with the very same cops and the very same sign in the lawn as the dream. (It was the sign outside of my apartment).

I got 18 month’s probation with random alcohol testing. It ended up causing me to be fired from that job. 

I stopped drinking and never touched blow again.

“It’s going to happen and it’s going to be for your own good.”

Sure was.

So based on that I know God knows every detail of our lives before they happen. I also know he plans events for specific reasons. 


I have another even crazier story, but I’m curious to hear what you guys have got."

It got me thinking in the case of one state, how to maintain both a Jewish and democratic majority. (Note, this excludes Gaza). Although between the river and the sea a Jewish majority exists, it is not politically large enough (It is however predicted to increase, higher Jewish birth rates). Therefore, I came up with a compromise I think many will be happy.

In 1975, Israeli minister of defense, Shimon Peres, was interviewed on CBS’s “Face the nation”. When asked about solutions, he was quoted as saying: “We can either partition the land, or the government”. Hence, I thought we ought to rethink the way we approach the peace process and so here is my idea:

The land between the Mediterranean and the river, excluding Gaza, will be partitioned into three nominally self governing states, namely Israel, Judea, and Palestine. These states will compose: Israel proper (including Golan and East Jerusalem), Judea (will be the settlements, not contiguous) and Palestine (the rest of the West Bank, will span the majority of it). The states will be self governed, however maintain a unified foreign policy and defense policy. The way it will work: 

-Open borders, to allow the growth of the Palestinian economy.

-Only the state of Israel will maintain a military, the one it presently has, the IDF will be     maintained, hence defense poli cy will be only in the hands of the state of Israel, as well as control over external borders.

-Each territory will have their own passports, however these passports also allow free movement between the areas (something akin to EU passports). 

- A joint council (akin to the EU parliament) for various political decisions requiring a joint consensus, i.e with regards to foreign policy for example, with each state allocated the same amount of seats, hereby allowing Jews to maintain a political majority.

The arrangement will be somewhere between the EU and the USA in terms of governance and autonomy and statehood.

Am I missing something? Let me know, and I’m curious hearing your opinion about it."
1,2023-07-27,Let's clear up the debate here and make it more serious. British Mandate.,u/ILovMeth,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15ay6ir/lets_clear_up_the_debate_here_and_make_it_more/,"Disclaimer: With this text I'm not looking for demonization of Israel, rather to expose the truth and offer the path to reconciliation. Nation states tend to be born in blood. Israel is not an exception to this rule, rather glaring confirmation. Israelis are no better or worse than most of today's nation state. What is wrong, though, is the continuous denial or justification of their crimes which is running rampant in this subreddit.  


Hello,  


I'm college student. I'm undergraduate student of political science. Since I have taken a course Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I became really interested in this topic. What I find most fascinating is the level of what I call intelectual dishonesty on the side of people ardently in support of Israel. I'm very biased in this topic, I'm on the Palestinian side and this text serves as explanation. Since this is social problem(meaning it is between people), what matters is the POV one chooses to view such conflict. POV, paradigm or framework. This text will be in the framework of logic of elimination and ethnic cleansing - [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14623520601056240), [1,5](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/ethnic-cleansing.shtml). Using these for my framework is crucial to see why, I believe, Palestinians are in the right and Israelis are not, yet they refuse to acknowledge that as well as their supporters. Remember, this is not scholarly text, just my thoughts which I'm trying to portray as serious as I can on subreddit.  


The level of intelectual dishonesty is all the more serious and shocking, because this conflict, as it is normaly called, because of the amount of literature that has been devoted to it so I find it outrageous to see glaring mistakes being repeated over and over by supporters of Israel in this subreddit.   


First we start with Zionism. Zionism is a nationalist movement developed in 19th century that basicaly says that Jews in diaspora constitutes one nation which should emigrate to Palestine to create safe-haven to escape rampant anti-semitism prevalent in Europe. What is interesting that it combines religion(judaism) and secular nationalism into one - [2](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zionism) Which meant that Jews from diaspora where they have lived for centuries are somehow entitled to the land of Palestine, using Bible as their source of legitimacy. Zionists pouring into the Palestine were mostly European by origin, Eastern European to be precise.   
""Prior to World War I, Zionism represented only a minority of Jews, mostly from Russia but led by Austrians and Germans."" - [3](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zionism)  
Here I make first assumption: People coming from diaspora(mostly from Europe) CANNOT be regarded as natives to the land of Palestine.   
Zionists were aware of it, but did not make much of it, for them native Arabs were mostly invisible or atleast they did not care much about them and their legitimate claim to the land they were living on. Various agencies were set up like [Jewish Colonisation association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Colonisation_Association) to urge Jews from diaspora to immigrate to Palestine and settle the land. They were in, however, for a rude awakening when they discovered that the land set up for their safe haven was already occupated by somebody else.   


Let's briefly examine the clashes between native Arab population and Zionist settlers. As it goes with all settler movements, the clashes were inevitable, as Patrick Wolfe argues whose ""logic of elimination I'm using for my framework, it all boils down to the ownership of the land, land = survival. Remember, Zionists pouring into the Palestine were not used to rural life, they needed the natives for their survival. They learned from them to settle the land. Thing is, Zionists viewed Palestinian natives as something alien, something which does not belong in their safe haven, their ancient homeland, they perceived them as invaders. That is what Illan Papé claims in his book 10 myths of Israel and Ethnic cleansing of Palestine. -  [5](https://www.amazon.com/Myths-About-Israel-Ilan-Pappe/dp/1786630192), [6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ethnic_Cleansing_of_Palestine). Benny Morris is similiar in his conclusions. He says that transfer(ethnic cleansing) of Palestinians is inbuilt in Zionism. [7](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/03/the-lonely-historian/303118/), [8](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2016-10-14/ty-article/.premium/yes-benny-morris-it-was-ethnic-cleansing-in-1948/0000017f-da72-d938-a17f-fe7a4a4f0000). 

Here I make my second assumption: no matter what the Palestinians would do, they would still end up ethnicaly cleansed.  


Let's put the Zionist migration into the Palestine into the broader picture. We are talking the time period of 1918-1947 - so called British Mandate of Palestine. Let's briefly examine that. Until the 1918 the region of Middle East was mostly under the control of Ottoman Empire. - [9](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/q9fkm0/destruction_of_the_ottoman_empire_under_the_young/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). During 1 WW which was fought from 1914-1918 British Empire was trying to flare up the independence movements in the region to break up the Ottoman Empire, using Arabs living under their control to rise up and help the side of the Entete powers to defeat the Central powers, Ottoman Empire in this case. [10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I), [11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt). In which they succeeded. They promised independence for Arabs, at the same time, British were supporting Zionist movement, issuing Balfour declaration in 1917 [12](https://www.britannica.com/event/Balfour-Declaration). In which they promised Zionists to create Jewish national home in Palestine. Here we can see that British promised two fundamentaly opposed side two things that were in opposition to each other. In 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement was signed between British and French empires, partitioning the Middle East for themselves. [13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement). Put bluntly, British played both sides and screw them both. After the 1 WW British acquired Palestine as a mandate territory by League of Nations, forebearer of the UN. During this time, Jewish(Zionist) immigration exploded. [14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine)  
Let's remember, before the Mandate period Jewish population was around 6 %. When the Mandate expired in 1947, Jewish population was making the third of the population. [15](https://www.palestineremembered.com/Acre/Maps/Story574.html), [16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region))   
This proves my first assumption that people coming into Palestine from diaspora(mostly Europe) are not natives.   


Let's examine the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. The Nakba. Once again briefly. Let's start with the most crucial part. The UN partition resolution 181 of 1947. Let's look at the population data once again. Jews made hardly a third of the population, as the data I provided shows, yet they were given 55 % of the land of which they were NOT native to, as I've established. The vote passed with 33 voting yes, 13 against and 10 abstaining. The argument goes that Jewish people accepted the resolution, Arabs boycotted the vote and immediately attacked the newly born state of Israel which was established on 14th of May 1948. [17](https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-Nations-Resolution-181), [18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel).  
Here we can ask ourselves a serious question. 56 countries in UNGA, today there are 193 countries. Where were they? Well, it was before the period of decolonization. Most of the world was still colonized. Therefore they did not have a vote. [19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization)  
As for the attack of Arabs. Arabs most certainly did not attack Israel, contrary is true, as Benny Morris has said that ethnic cleansing was inbuilt in Zionism, therefore Zionists always planned to get rid of Palestinians. Logic of elimination in this case provides the reason why. Patrick Wolfe argues that each settler colonial movement has positive and negative features to it. Negative: Movement of this kind seeks to destroy the society that was there before it. Positive: Seeks to create a new one after the destruction of the old one. Logic of elimination claims that all the natives have to do to invoke the wrath of the settler colonial movement is to stay at home. Therefore my second assumption is proven using logic of elimination. Therefore the War of Independence was not a war of independence at all, it was an attack against natives resulting in ethnic cleansing.  
Second proof is the context of when this took place. We are talking second half of the 20th century. Nation states were popping up all over the world. In Europe nation states suffered deformity which undermined their functionality - sizeable minorities. Transfer of Germans(ethnic cleansing) from states such as Russia(Kaliningrad), Poland and what is today Czechia(Sudetenland) was done in order to create ethnicaly homogenous states to function properly by getting rid of the sizeable minorities.   
Third proof is from the book called Blaming the Victims: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian Question available in PDF. Reading the chapter called ""Truth whereby nations live"" we can see that the ethnic cleansing was planned and deliberate, not a result of war. This chapter captures the story of Ben Dunkelman who during the war of 1948 captured the city of Nazaret. The city surrendered, he was then given an order to ""evacuate the city"". He refused and asked for that order to be written down. It wasn't and so the Nazaret to this day remains Arab city. Author goes on saying similiar order was issued to Jitzchak Rabin, then one of the commanders. He carried that order out.   


After the war against native was over, newly borned state of Israel has kicked of its existence by ethnicaly cleansing the natives - more than 700 000 people were driven from their homes. It was deliberate attack to create ethnicaly homogenous nation state following the logic of elimination and the ""rules"" of the nation states in the 2nd half of the 20th century. The logic of elimination further manifested itself when Israel raised 500 villages to the ground. [20](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/25/study-1948-israeli-massacre-tantura-palestinian-village-mass-graves-car-park). And on their places created new ones. As I'v established using Patrick Wolfe's logic of elimination: ""destroy the old society, to create a new one.""  As Theodor Herzl, founding father of Zionism, observed in his allegorical manifesto/novel, “If I wish to substitute anew building for an old one, I must demolish before I construct. [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14623520601056240) The settler colonial society wishes to destroy any traces of former society. Tantura is next great example. Tantura is a fishing village where Zionists militias culled the population and dumped their bodies into the mass graves, there is no marker of the atrocity today, on the possible location of the mass grave there is a parking lot. [20](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/25/study-1948-israeli-massacre-tantura-palestinian-village-mass-graves-car-park)  


There is no reason to justify the atrocities committed by Israel in its founding moments. Benny Morris went as far as justifying it, comparing it to US's destruction of Indians - that it was a good thing, because had it not happened, there would be no US. [21](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1559295)  


Honest debate must include the clear and serious recognition of atrocities and wrong doings on the Israeli part. Only that will lead to reconciliation. Coming to terms with your own mistakes is always hard, Israel is not alone in this struggle. We can see it in the US. Where Republicans instead of ackowleding the horrors of Jim Crow and slavery went as far as teaching kids in Florida the benefits of slavery for black Americans. [22](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/floridas-new-education-standards-says-slavery-had-personal-benefits/)

Sorry for the Hebrew article, I will add a full Google translate version in the comments.

A united Palestinian government once again, putting peaceful resistance as it's main objective? Do you think it's all BS and lies or are we possibly seeing a new Hamas, with the understanding that international pressure and peaceful ways of resistance are far more effective than a thousand rockets?

I believe that if the Palestinians will truly put down their weapons, it's only a matter of time before pressure, both within Israel and the international community, to give them a state of their own will prevail.

Of course only time will tell, as words are easy to speak but actions speak the loudest, and this was one of the most deadly years of the decade (If not the most deadly?) as far as Palestinian terrorism and violence.

This is just about the Jewish genealogy side of DNA testing.

So, I am 25% Ashkenazi by blood (grandpa was born Jewish, grandma converted - the other side is Gentile). I am doing some in-depth analysis of my DNA data from MyHeritage and GEDMatch, looking at the DNA myself to try to find some groups of distant relatives with the same chunks of DNA, which indicates a common ancestor. 

Well, the more I sort into just the largest exact DNA sequences shared by a large number of people, I end up with lists of people that look like this (names altered slightly for privacy) - like maybe not 100% of these are Jews, but it's likely, right?

    Simon Goodman, Masha Vogel, Boris Friedman, David Singer, Tatiana Lutvak, Daniel Kettinger, Agnes Kirzhner, Jan Perlman, Svetlana Nivin, Ariel Geller, Bracha Glattman

So .... is it just a thing that Ashkenazi DNA is more closely matched because of the bottleneck effect? Do these clusters have less meaning than similar clusters in the Gentile parts of my family - basically do all these close matches just mean ""generic Ashkenazi Jew"" rather than ""this group of people is closely tied to my ancestors in particular""?

Wondering if anyone else who is from a mixed lineage has noticed something similar with Ashkenazi DNA vs other DNA. The Jewish side of my family is probably the hardest to trace (for obvious reasons) so I'm looking for any possible methods."
1,2023-07-27,The story that solidified my belief in God,u/Right_Measurement,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/15b207q/the_story_that_solidified_my_belief_in_god/,"I posted a different story yesterday illustrating a dream that came true literally.  This was prior to that.  Keep in mind despite having a Jewish (by blood grandma) my family is not Jewish at all in practice and I originally would have assumed Christianity was the way to go because it’s the American norm.

It’s also worth noting I have an American sounding name Robert James Morgan because my mom is not religious and she married a non Jew.

Prior to this story happening I had an extremely powerful supernatural experience happen to aware me of Gods presence so I got interested in learning about religion.  I’ve since come to grips with Judaism but at this time in my life (roughly 12 years ago) I wouldn’t have known why Christianity wasn’t the ticket to God.

With that in mind here is the story.. 


Me and my then girlfriend Holly were at her moms house watching her dogs while she was away on a ski trip. 

Holly went to target and while she was there she decided to buy us both bibles. 

They were student Bibles published by a guy named Robert J Morgan. His website is www.RobertJMorgan.com I know this because there was a foreword he wrote at the beginning of the Bible for students. 

This wouldn’t have mattered if my name wasn’t Robert J Morgan.. but since it is.. it seemed very relevant!!! 

Keep in mind Holly had no idea my name was in this book when she bought it. 

So here I was reading this prologue when I stumbled across my full name in the print. Seemed to be a bit too exact to be a coincidence so I decided to offer up a prayer right then and there. 

“God this seems to be proof you’re real but I want one more thing to make sure I’m not reading too much into this.  Holly has to work tomorrow but I want her to be off.” 

I didn’t tell her I offered that prayer… we were about an hour away from her job and she was supposed to open a Blockbuster the next day. (She was the assistant manager). 

I wake up and she’s laying in bed next to me… 

“Holly why aren’t you at work?”

“I was leaving the driveway and my car fish tailed on the ice. I hit the big rock in the neighbors lawn and it broke my axel. Nobody could give me a ride so they gave me the day off.”

I’ve never doubted Gods existence since and never will.  

I’m curious to hear your thoughts"

Most notably with him saying that the only reason why they're ahead of the N\*zis is because of antisemitism, with them calling Quantum Mechanics, 'Jewish Science'.

There is such a thing as *human* rights; no such thing as *states’* rights. No state has a “right to exist”—Neither Israel nor any other state. States are apparatuses which administer the affairs of a certain population in a certain territory, not war machines on behalf of a certain identity against others. It is thus the persons who make up this society who have the democratic right to exist and to decide how their state will administer their society, including what is commonly known as the right of self-determination.  


The Zionist project has disregarded the basic democratic rights of the (Jewish and non-Jewish) population of Palestine by effecting, with essential British colonial help, the mass immigration of non-Palestinians to Palestine prior to 1948 and by establishing a ""state exclusive to Jews"" in Palestine in 1948 with no democratic mandate to do so. The continued existence of a state exclusive to Jews rather than a democratic state of all its citizens means that the trampling of these democratic human rights is ongoing and is therefore not “right”.

  
A transition to One Democratic State of all its citizens would right this century-old wrong and would be a historic step in achieving just and lasting peace in Palestine and the Middle East.

Source: [https://www.wiesenthal.com/about/news/swc-calls-on-amazon-prime-to.html](https://www.wiesenthal.com/about/news/swc-calls-on-amazon-prime-to.html)

The Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC), a leading human rights NGO dedicated to the memory of the victims of the Nazi Holocaust, is urging Amazon Prime to remove the film *Bawaal* due to its outlandish abuse of the Nazi Holocaust as a plot device. Directed by well-known Indian filmmaker Nitesh Tiwari, the film’s storyline which is set in contemporary times, leads to scenes in which the protagonists enter a gas chamber in Auschwitz and are suffocated while wearing striped clothing. Hitler is used as a metaphor in the movie for human greed, with the main protagonist, saying to his wife: “We’re all a little like Hitler, aren’t we?”

**“Auschwitz is not a metaphor. It is the quintessential example of Man’s capacity for Evil,”** charged SWC Associate Dean and Director of Global Social Action, Rabbi Abraham Cooper.

**“By having the protagonist in this movie declare that ‘Every relationship goes through their Auschwitz,’ Nitesh Tiwari, trivializes and demeans the memory of 6 million murdered Jews and millions of others who suffered at the hands of Hitler’s genocidal regime.”**

**“If the filmmaker’s goal was to gain PR for their movie by reportedly filming a fantasy sequence at the Nazi death camp, he has succeeded. Amazon Prime should stop monetizing** ***Bawaal*** **by immediately removing this banal trivialization of the suffering and systematic murder of millions of victims of the Nazi Holocaust,”** Rabbi Cooper concluded. 

UPDATE: Indian news media is starting to pick up on this press release:

I won’t name the family member for anonymity, but they (a woman) are extremely angry at me (a man) for my honesty about halacha. They sort of cornered me because they wanted me to give them a specific answer, and I couldn’t. I won’t go into specifics, but it was about a woman’s role from an Orthodox standpoint, as well as lgbt issues and a few other stuff. 

Without slandering this family member, their goal was clearly to incite animosity because of our very different worldviews. I respect them and made it clear I in no way judge them, but I also was clear about halacha. I couldn’t think of the name of the prohibition, but I personally on an ethical level cannot lie about my beliefs when it comes from HaShem. I’m not here to preach to people or insult liberal jews (and I realize and respect their very different worldview). My family member clearly does not respect mine, but I wasn’t rude or insulting, I simply stated halacha from Orthodoxy’s standpoint and told this person I cannot change the religion, nor would I to suit them. I felt compelled to not lie about either the fundamentals of my faith nor my own views on them. I simply stated “I won’t violate the Torah to placate you as an individual” and since then this person has slandered me to other family members as a misogynist and homophobe.

I’m not here to slander this person, I love them very much and respect them but I did not feel I could lie about halacha. If someone could inform me about specific prohibitions I’d appreciate it (with references if possible), as well as any leniences to deal with future situations that are similar."

Apparently my great grandmother performed certain Jewish rituals she had been taught (covering mirrors after deaths etc.) but had been raised Protestant per her father’s side. 

My aunt (now passed) identified as Jewish and her children went to Hebrew school/had mitzvahs etc. but I’m not sure if she converted or somehow had the ancestry confirmed. Our family is a little fractured and it’s all very mysterious.

I’ve had a look at the family tree on my mother’s side (dating back to around 1700) and tried searching for the surnames on Jewish ancestry sites, but haven’t been able to find any solid evidence of this link beyond this vague family legend.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cs1u8h00kneb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e67266deefa338f1aed09bf48d421f4fdb04ff29

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

Three of the fundamental concepts underlying human interaction are commitment, intention, and the use of language.

When I commit to my fellow human beings, I limit my own future options but improve their ability to plan. I enable cooperation between us and everybody is more likely to achieve their own goals in comparison to the state of mistrust. Commitment involves introducing new sub-rules in the shared game we play, which shape our larger game.

We make decisions by predicting alternative futures. We consider how events might unfold if A happens and compare that to what we expect might follow if B happens. These events, A or B, can include our own actions or unforeseen circumstances beyond our control. In each scenario, we consider the possible reactions of ourselves and others.

Our intentions are defined by the behaviors we decide upon in these alternative futures. For example, if I run out of money, I intend to do X. If the baby cries at night, I intend to do Y.

We express these intentions to others using words. By articulating our intentions, we establish the building blocks of collaboration and commitment.

What happens if the future turns out to be like none of the alternatives scenarios we imagined when making a commitment? What if something totally unexpected happens? What if we believed we would succeed at something but were mistaken?

Imagine I say to my colleague, ""I will stay here until I finish the job, *whatever happens*."" Then something unexpected arises, or I can't seem to complete the task. I explicitly used the phrase ""whatever happens,"" leaving no room for ambiguity. It implies that there is no possible alternative that can change my commitment to finish.

In today's world, guilt is often less valued than in past cultures, and most moral systems are not considered absolute truths. However, the notion that we are obligated to abide by the rules we agreed upon has not lost its significance. It is said that even the most murderous criminals consider keeping their word as sacred.

So how can we justify forgiving a failure to uphold commitments due to unforeseen circumstances, even if there is no interpretation of our words that would justify this?

One answer is that words carry more meaning than their surface interpretation. Even when we say ""whatever happens,"" it actually means ""whatever might *reasonably* happen.""

Another answer is that these failures are simply logical shortcomings. We use indefinite pronouns like ""all,"" ""none,"" ""never,"" ""whenever,"" or ""any"" as alternatives to describing every possibility. However, we can never truly consider every possibility due to our limited imagination or time. In the world of computer programming, these are known as ""bugs."" We live with these bugs in our speech.

On one hand, reneging on commitments without cause is universally seen as morally wrong. On the other hand, it is unreasonable to never allow for the extremely unlikely. In reality, this is likely a spectrum, with our behavior falling somewhere between the two extremes.

The challenge lies in determining where the current situation falls on that spectrum. We often put a thumb on the scale. Who are we really? Who do we want to become?"

The obvious solution here is to start filtering & locking down Gaza's internet. Other similar authorities in the Middle-East have used the excuse that no resident in their right mind would think differently from stated ""allowed"" thought (Syria, Iran and others) so have used measures to ""lock down"" and limit their civilians freedoms. Dictatorship regimes can rule for centuries and Hamas rule has only just begone (it's only ruling for around 15 years out of several decades or centuries) so the only *logical* course of action here is to limit citizen's freedoms.

I'm sure Hamas can use the excuse that no Gazan in their right mind would resist and attack the holy and just resistance, that those people are ""Mossad agents"" or paid off by Israel to stir up troubles. The next obvious step would be to block twitter and the link.

without photos of burying IED or human rights violations there'll be no reporting. The official statements even with the PA is that every Palestinian Israel or IDF kills is a premeditated murder using unlawful force against an ""innocent civilian"" who was just driving his car with his buddies to work.

So my brother just came here for his mechina.  However, he left his girlfriend in the US and he hasn’t really done much except talk to her and go to the beach, and he’s been pretty negative about israel.  We’re worried he’s gonna try to drop out of the mechina even though I think he has the potential to love it here.  He also really hates the heat. 

I want to take him on a fun day trip that will show him the beauty of this country.  I was able to persuade him by saying that we can go to a forested mountain in the north and swim in order to avoid the heat.  He loves nature and food, and he’s a friendly kid.  

I was thinking, what’s the perfect view+swim+meal combo in the north?  

TIA :)"

I apparently I don’t have to go to the army because I have a Spanish nationality but I’m not sure how that works, is it true?
If I were someone who lived in Israel I would be kinda pissed at people like me coming from abroad getting better benefits than a resident and not serving in the army.  I know it might sound selfish but if I don’t have to then I’m not tryin to spend 3 years in the army and I don’t wanna hear about why I should."

So that's a reality I've got to face now. I'm moving to Israel, for repatriation (aliyah). I usually don't have a big problem moving between different countries, but I've never been in Israel before, I don't speak Hebrew or Arabic and I've never been in an Israeli shop or supermarket before. I feel like I won't be able to manage what little money I have properly, much less find people who will help me out. I'm completely lost and scared that I'll just fail miserably in general, and I can barely find any resources to read up on Israel and moving there (at least resources that don't say everything will be absolutely perfect and full of flowers and roses). 

Another issue I find scary is the fact that I'm 19. I don't know what Israelis do at 19, I've heard people saying they go for IDF, but then when do they go for university? What happens in IDF? What will be my options after/before IDF and Ulpan? 

I don't know, I'm just looking for someone to tell me the truth and discuss this topic in a realistic manner, without all the stuff like ""oh man everything is gonna be amazing they're gonna take you in like you're one of them and help guide you by hand"""

Obviously, this is inherently contradictory. It's not like you can take one and leave the other. But looking past the issues within such a view for a moment, isn't this simply pandering to the rest of the fervently anti-Israel world? 

&#x200B;

Anytime I've seen a jew rail against zionism, you get non-jews salivating, jumping at the opportunity to go ""now that's a good man, he knows what's up"" as if that isn't just about the most obnoxiously condescending thing in the world. 

&#x200B;

At the same time, this isn't a perfect situation. The israeli government has made tons of mistakes. There absolutely are a lot of racist, violent israelis. Innocent palestinians have been misplaced. 

&#x200B;

Why does Israel exist? One of the world's favorite pastimes is jerking each other off on their supposed moral superiority over the evil jews who are now the new nazis (they love to compare jews to nazis, isn't that clever??? first they were they were victims of nazis, now THEY are the nazis!! get it?!). 

&#x200B;

But again, why does Israel exist? Because the same world that deems Israel to be an evil state, created the need for it in the first place.

&#x200B;

Is it not then, a jew's duty to land somewhere in the middle? One must understand the need for and support the notion of a jewish state, without which jews are simply not safe in the world, while at the same time recognising the issues that plague such a complex situation, and trying to fix these problems, so that innocent palestinians and jews may not be harmed.

&#x200B;

All too often I see fervent anti-zionists, and fervent zionists. Evidently neither position is sustainable.

Things that the human animal can desire (taavah). The second Temple was destroyed because of baseless hatred from pride (gaavah). It's been about 1,956 years since the destruction of the second Temple. Today 2023 (5783) and we Jewish Israelites are still struggling with taavah and gaavah without a Temple. Eretz Yisrael is in turmoil with groups hating and attacking each other. The mere mention of Palestinians has 1/3 of us seeing red and the other 1/3 apathetic, and the other 1/3 crying at the inhumanity of their treatment. 

It is my sincere conviction that Mashiach ben Yosef and Mashiash ben David are here in the sense that their respective spirits hover over us awaiting worthy people to inhabit. Maybe endowed is a better word or imbued. I don't know but I hope it is understandable what I'm trying to say. 

We are getting things wrong when our inner Temples our inner selves are struggling in the societies we live in. How can we help each other make life easier for each other? How can we be a bracha for each other? Reduce each other's burden? Elevate each other? We want Mashiach now because the world needs peace. The environment needs peace. We need peace."

1,2023-07-28,Jewish Catalog's Impact,u/Connect-Brick-3171,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/15c78go/jewish_catalogs_impact/,"Nicely written article by an old acquaintance [https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/the-jewish-catalog-50th-anniversary/674846/](https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/the-jewish-catalog-50th-anniversary/674846/)

As a med student in the mid-1970s, I would take a clinical text to the Hillel library, then for breaks, browse the shelves.  The Jewish Catalog was a new book, all three editions completed by my graduation.  It made Judaism different, mostly better, but as the article suggests, shechting the Sacred Cows has its downsides too.  I think it made us less dependent on our institutions, less obedient to people of title, and more insistent that there is a personal Judaism that can only thrive when we see it as relating to us.  It really began the Jewish experience as something of an a la carte menu, but also had a lot of very talented people pondering ""what would happen if we did this instead.""  

In the fifty years since the first edition, women are a more visible presence, the number of kosher certified products and the spectrum of people purchasing them has expanded, parents who would not have considered day school now commit large sums to it.  More people hold their own seders and light Shabbat candles.  And at the same interval sanctuary attendance has waned, interest in flagship seminaries has faltered, in other ways legacy institutions are more dependent on smaller numbers of larger donors.  I don't think the Jewish Catalog series caused personalized Judaism as much as the possibilities the three books exposed made our legacy and umbrella institutions more accountable while sending the message that new startups going in novel directions could establish their own stable niches."

Half of my family in Europe was killed during that time. They were taken from their homes, put into a ghetto, then shipped off to Treblinka where they suffocated for 20 minutes from truck fumes being pumped into a room. If I remember correctly, the camp had a building decorated like a hospital where they’d send kids, elderly, and disabled people to get “health checks” but in reality were taken out back, shot into a pit, and burned in mass. Oppenheimer was aware of what was going on in Europe; one line he had towards the beginning was about how he was doing this because it was his people being killed by the Germans. He did this to stop the nazis from killing his family and his people. His entire motivations were to use the bomb on the nazis. Then the nazis surrendered and it was used on the Japanese. Only then did he realize what he had done. He had become death, destroyer of worlds. Just when you think about the Holocaust and its relationship to him, you think about it differently."

I'm just curious if Judaism has a similar understanding of how God works in human lives? My guess is not, but I wanted to ask, particularly because I am rather critical of this concept and believe it does harm to individuals.

1,2023-07-29,500 Palestinian Bedouins to be forcibly evicted and segregated: thoughts?,u/Distinct-Maybe719,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15cifab/500_palestinian_bedouins_to_be_forcibly_evicted/,"Links provided below, but this is about the Ras Jrabah evictions. With chats about Israel/Palestine in general, there’s a lot of back and forth that’s largely centered around physical violence, self defense, retaliation- things of that like. 
But, what I think deserves attention as well are the policies and institutions in place that favor Israelis over Palestinians. 

I’m not really posting this to ask why this is right or wrong, nor am I doing so to debate who’s view is right or wrong. I’m just curious about perspectives on this particular issue because it doesn’t involve any militants— all civilians. 

I suppose this is more geared to the Israelis and Zionists in the group, but do you also support projects like these? To be clear, that question isn’t one I ask in an accusatory tone- it’s difficult to convey through the internet. 


500+ people is quite a few, they were all fined money they don’t have on top of being displaced, were refused integration into the new neighborhood being built, and as of right now have no land to go to because the land offered by the Israeli government is bound up in ownership disputes. 

Do those of you who are pro-Israel see this as part of the broader defensive strategy? Do you support? Do you not support? I know there is a spectrum of opinions when it comes to being pro-Israel, so I’m very curious about attitudes and feelings toward cases like this.

I was hoping to get a book recommendation from someone who might know what I am looking for. 

&#x200B;

The christian theologian Paul TILLICH wrote a book called a history of christian thought from its Judaic and hellenistic origns to existentialism. 

I was hoping someone might be able to recommend me any similiar books from a jewish thinker that covers the same ground of a brief intellectual-philosophical-cultural history from the ancient times up to existentialism?

Any recommendations would be seriously appreciated especially with a philosophical focus.

Thanks!!!"
1,2023-07-29,A good way to incentivize aliyah,u/Joe-586,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15cjggx/a_good_way_to_incentivize_aliyah/,"I don't think we should be pressuring diaspora Jews right now to make aliyah.. but I do believe that we should take steps to make the process of aliyah more enticing.

On a particularly long drive today I came up with a semi working idea and im interested in what the good people of this subreddit think. This way would ensure that any and all Jewish citizens in Israel are going to be at minimum, lower middle class, and that the empty slot of the lower class would be reserved for Arabs who have made it clear time and time again they aren't interested in our elections.

I propose taxing 80% of all earnings/income made by Arabs over 8,000 NIS per month, taxing 20% of all earnings made under that per month, while maintaining a uniform tax rate of 15% for all Jewish citizensthat would gradually decrease to \~5% in a few decades time. This can ensure that Olim don't have to pay ridiculous amounts to the government in taxes and that they're able to maintain a standard of living comparable to the one they had in the diaspora. It helps ensure that Arabs remain in the lower class and Jews on the wealthier side in the diaspora can rest easy, come back to their homeland without having to worry about being some Kibbutz farmers in a garbage neighborhood in E. Jerusalem. More and more Jewish families would likely come to Israel because of the comfortable financial situation they found themselves in due to this policy.

But there's a catch, given that Arabs would be getting higher taxes, Israel should fully subsidize housing units for Arabs specifically, preferably in the negev (although the location is by and large irrelevant) similar to Khrushchevkas or more colloquially known as 'commie blocks'. Before you start bursting at this idea I'd encourage you to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eIxUuuJX7Y) video explaining how commie blocks aren't as bad as people think they are, in fact I suspect that a strong sense of local community will be built around these Arab commie blocks that Jewish communities can't compete with, so Jews might actually envy Arabs in this regard.

As for Jewish housing, Israel should be expanding vertically not horizontally, it should take more advantage of the land in the galilee. Eventually Arabs might be too demographically strong and 'class conscious' ( i hate that word) for it to be a problem after they get used to their cushy lives in Israel, so Israel should try integrating the loyal Arabs as citizens with full equal rights to Jews eventually, and punish those who seek to wreak havoc or harm Israel, maybe push aggressively for streamlined visa and citizenship application processes for Arabs (and only Arabs, *NOT* Jews) in the EU and elsewhere.

I hope you are all doing well. I am posting here because I have a unique situation and am seeking some guidance and advice.

I was born to a Jewish mother, but religiously, I didn't grow up Jewish. However, I've recently felt a strong desire to explore and connect with my Jewish heritage. It's essential for me to learn more about Judaism, its traditions, and culture.

The thing is, I have dyslexia, which makes traditional reading challenging for me. But that won't stop me from exploring Judaism! I'm eager to find alternative ways to learn and engage with the Jewish community.

I'm looking for recommendations for podcasts, audio materials, videos, and other accessible resources that can help me learn more about Judaism. Also, if you know of any inclusive online Jewish communities, I'd love to be a part of them.

Any advice, suggestions, or personal experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated. I'm open to hearing from anyone who can offer support and insights on my journey to reconnect with my Jewish roots.

Thank you all in advance for your help!"

They did not specify whether they would be killed or expelled.  


[According to official records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine#Jewish_immigration), between 1920-1948, 367,845 Jews and 33,304 non-Jews immigrated legally to Mandatory Palestine. While Jewish immigration was certainly more significant, non-Jewish immigrant at the period is still at a respectable 10% of the total Jewish immigration. Every single one of them would be allowed to remain in the 'United State of Palestine' envisioned by the Higher Committee, while every immigrant identified as Jewish will be promptly disposed of.

Only 4 years prior to 1920, the ideological predecessors and ethnic compatriots of these Arab Nationalists would participate in or endorse the [Arab Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt) against the Ottoman Empire, and directly copy the design of its flag to create their new Palestinian national flag. Clearly, they themselves seem to recognize the objective fact that the Ottoman Empire is a foreign Imperialist entity with little more legitimacy than the British Empire, and yet for some reason their reign has been selected as the arbitrary cutoff point under which Jewish immigrants may be considered legitimate - in a rather convenient fashion, since while the Ottoman era saw some notable Arab migration waves to Palestine, such as the [founding of Modern Ramallah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah#Ottoman_era) by Ghassanid settlers, but very little Jewish immigration.  


This same stance is still being passionately defended in various middle-eastern and ""leftist"" communities on Reddit and elsewhere, insisting that it would've been the appropriate treatment for 'Illegal colonizers' ( Which are apparently only illegal if they happen to be Jews holding legal British immigration documents, but non-Jews holding the same British documents ) similarly to the French in Algeria, and that it would in fact still be a just measure if applied to Israeli Jews today.  


On the other hand, to an unbiased observer examining the moral consistency of this edict, it may shockingly come across as a cynical Arab Supremacist double standard specifically contrived to ethnically cleanse Jews from the land while sparing themselves. What do you think?"

a few weeks back i remembered my dad making a comment along the lines of: “don’t you think it’s kind of funny that we have a picture of jesus hanging up over a menorah?”. i giggled because i was always confused by it. my mom is dumb i’m not even going to lie. but i don’t know why i never connected those two pieces of information- i just thought she was being her old religious nut self again. 

i recognized the term “messianic” in that post and was really confused, as i knew my mom described herself as a messianic jew and even invited me to take a messianic judaism class with her (which i’m so happy that i turned down), but i had just trusted her to teach me about it as my interest in my lineage grew. i’m 19- so i should have known better and i should have known to research it before anything. i just feel so betrayed because i trusted her. i trusted the fact that she wouldn’t try to evangelize me (as she’s done in the past) and that she was trying to help me find a good foundation of faith that I WANTED. i took everything with a grain of salt and never believed what she believed in regards to jesus. but i feel disgusting for inviting my friends over for Passover or celebrating Hanukkah for the first time last year with my family- which wasn’t even celebrated correctly. 

i feel even more disgusted because whether or not she realizes it- she's taking advantage of the faith of THOUSANDS of people that have been discriminated against since the beginning of time. jews WERE discriminated against because they did not see jesus as their savior. she's verbatim going against the beliefs of her ancestors. she's going against the beliefs of an entire culture for her own agenda

i don’t know where to begin. i want to learn the proper basis of the faith. i wanted to convert to judaism, but her ideas on it pushed me away. 

so i guess i’m posting this here to ask: where do i begin? does anyone have any helpful resources on learning about TRUE judaism? any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated."

Her mom didn't leave her with a lot of money (pretty much only enough to pay for the funeral), and she isn't well off because she has disabilities that prevent her from working, so she lives off of disability checks.

It bothers me so much seeing people here in the west (who don’t have to do with the conflict) supporting Palestine because of these videos on social media simply because they don’t have knowledge on this. 

To these people, Israelis are Europeans who hurt Palestinians for a laugh when in reality Israelis aren’t colonizers and these videos of the IDF having gates, filling in wells and striking Gaza are dramatically out of context. Even when you try to prove them wrong, they will simply quote something from the UN, B’Tselem or Amnesty. 

It’s making me sad and actually kind of angry these Middle Age era tactics are working. To find truthful answers on this you actually have to look for it and people don’t know about how much of media lies. 

What can we do to stop Misinformation from Antisemites?"

I’ve been to Ramallah, Hebron, Nablus, Jericho, and some small villages. I have been to these places by myself and have never experienced any problems. Locals are always very friendly and smoke lots of cigarettes with me. 

The last major Palestinian city I have yet to visit is Jenin. Why do I want to go to Jenin? It has the third oldest church in the world, I hear the olive oil is amazing, and I’d like to see a performance at the Freedom Theatre. There’s also other historical sites in and around the city. It is also an important place in Palestinian culture and history, so I’d like to see it and speak with people there. 

I’m just concerned about the security situation. I’m worried that some people, especially armed groups in the city, may mistake me for a Mossad agent or something and get mad, since they don’t really get any tourists and face constant raids, especially in the refugee camp where the Freedom Theatre is. People might view some white guy randomly walking around greeting people in terrible Fusha with suspicion. 

However, Nablus also faces similar issues and the local population was extremely friendly. So should I expect Jenin to be different from Nablus? 

Some more details, I’m an American from a Cuban and Christian background. I do speak some broken Fusha too."
1,2023-07-29,Feedback on my pet theory for why Israel's fertility rate is so high,u/Kasprosian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/15cxtge/feedback_on_my_pet_theory_for_why_israels/,"Hello. Not an Israeli or Jewish. I'm American. Just looking for feedback from people who actually live in Israel.

I have a theory on why Israel is a unique exception among countries with a high fertility rate. I plan to write an essay on it because the topic is so important. But before I do that, I thought I should ask Israel people first. Just in case I'm wrong.

OK, theory is: A really big purpose of having children is old age insurance. No matter what, your kids will be there to help. As Warren Buffett says in one of his annual meetings: Social Security moves the retirement obligations from the family to the state. However, Buffett totally misses the ***second order effects***: why have kids for retirement if you can just tax and force other people's kids to fund your retirement instead? Surprise surprise........fertility rates are not only low, but NOT stable, STILL declining, trending towards ZERO.

Now why is Israel different? Because you don't have a gov-guaranteed retirement plan (...correct?). My research shows your retirement plan is largely privatized. The gov guarantees only up to \~$420/month (USD) -- even then, it's means-tested? Basically the gov guarantees almost nothing in retirement. $420/month is hardly anything in a high cost of living society like Israel.

Further hypothesis:

* 0 gov guarantee retirement ==> fertility rate of 6+ (see China before communist revolution)
* some gov guarantee ==> fertility of 3 (Israel ONLY)
* ALL guaranteed by gov ===> fertility rate dropping, not stable, and approaching ZERO

Questions:

* Do people in Israel see children as important to their retirement plans?
* What are counterexamples to my theory? Countries with gov-guaranteed retirement plans, yet also have high fertility rate
   * Saudi Arabia is not valid counterexample -- it's 2.46, but boy is it declining fast. Whereas Israel's fertility rate is holding steady at \~3.
* Is my theory wrong?"

One day he was outside and two young boys in their teens, came up to him, one of them was Jewish and the other was German, they told him they were trying to escape from the nazis and the German boy said he didn’t want to become one of them, so he built a compartment in the wall where they could hide, then he told his son, my great grandfather to go outside and act like you’re feeding the chickens and alert me when the Nazis arrive. When they did they asked him if he had seen the boys, to which he obviously replied “No” and after they left he sent them on their way with good luck. much later after this story, my grandfather received a letter from the family of one of the boys thanking them, because if he didn’t do what he did, those boys likely wouldn’t have had a future and been able continue their family."

Essentially, Ayalon argues that while Palestinian security forces worked effectively with Israel to decrease terrorism, Israel increased illegal settlements and failed to deliver promised occupied territory. The predictable result: violent resistance from the Palestinian street and greater popular support for Hamas.  
Consider three examples from the book.  
1. Prime Minister Peres Fails To Deliver  
In January 1996, Prime Minister Shimon Peres promised the Shin Bet substantial funds to fight terrorism. Ayalon responded “that money wouldn’t be enough. ‘Ultimately, ending terrorism depends on politics.’…\[Security services can only\] fight back the flames to create breathing room for the politicians to launch a political process. \[And, he added,\] ‘To hunt down the terrorists, we are also going to need Arafat’…This, of course, was the logic of Oslo…” (p. 126)

Nonetheless, I'm not sure where else to turn.  I'm struggling with my Jewishness!  While I've brought this issue up with many people (and rabbis), I never get much  of an answer.

I went through the typical Jewish proceedings at birth, grew up going to shul and had my bar mitzvah. I continued there, went to Hillel in college, and am involved in many Jewish communities today. It's always been a big part of my life. While my dad isn't Jewish, I never had any qualms about that for obvious reasons. My mom IS Jewish, but by way an Ashkenazi father and a *converted* mother.

Here's my question: can I feel secure in my Jewishness? Can I be a part of these communities without feeling imposter syndrome? Or am I fooling myself? I know by some standards I am not Jewish. But I also have steered clear of more conservative communities and have stuck to pluralist, reform and reconstructionist congregations.

I’d like to have a study partner to discuss Torah with, especially regarding the weekly parashah at the minimum so I (and hopefully you) can better comprehend the guf of Torah. 

We may do this over Reddit or Discord. Comment or message me. Toda rabah and looking forward to starting. 

Any other guidance would be much appreciated."
1,2023-07-30,How can Israel end the Gaza blockade and West Bank occupation while still keeping its citizens safe?,u/Unique-kitten,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15d5er2/how_can_israel_end_the_gaza_blockade_and_west/,"Hi everyone

A common reason I see people provide for why the Gaza blockade and West Bank occupation are justified is that they help keep Israeli civilians safe from terrorism. This seems like it is true to me, and keeping Israelis safe is always a good cause, but one cannot deny that innocent Gaza and West Bank Palestinians suffer from these security measures, which act as collective punishment. 

I also think that while the blockade and occupation help Israelis in the short-term by keeping them safe, in the long-term they pose a detriment in that they make ending the conflict more difficult. Living under a blockade and occupation makes Palestinians angry at Israel, making them less likely to want to agree to a peaceful one state or two state solution. 

Israel has a very well-funded and well-trained military, so I sometimes wonder if the blockade and occupation are the only ways to protect Israelis from what will undoubtedly be an increase in terrorism if Gaza and the West Bank are freed. However, I don't know much about the specifics of IDF practices in the conflict, and I could very well be wrong about all this. So, to those who are more educated on this conflict than me, this is my question: If possible, how can Israel end the Gaza blockade and West Bank Occupation while still keeping its citizens safe?"

So I finished my conversion earlier this year. It was wonderful, and I loved the synagogue I joined. Then like a month later, I was unemployed and some personal stuff happened that triggered my agoraphobia and car related anxiety. I haven’t been back to synagogue in a month. 

Luckily, things are starting to look up. I have a job I really like, and I’m starting to get over the agoraphobia. But driving to the (reform) synagogue I was a part of still feels super daunting. I want to get back to temple, and I was thinking of finding a temple that’s closer to  where I live so the drive doesn’t feel so daunting. 

But for some reason, I just feel super guilty about it. Like the synagogue I was part of is absolutely wonderful. The problem is absolutely with me, and being scared of driving long distance in my car. So is it okay to move synagogues to somewhere closer?"

Not surprising since it’s common in the Askenazi Jewish population. My grandmother (mother’s mother) died when I was 10. Her sister, my great aunt, died young too. My aunt (my mother’s sister) had breast cancer about 10 years later and lived because it was caught early. My uncle (their brother) wasn’t so lucky - and he didn’t make it. About 20 years ago, I had a genetic test done and learned that I didn’t have the mutation— which was good news for my daughters too. My sister and my mother both tested positive for it and took preventative measures. Last year, my mother died of cancer.   My cousin, who is 57 and a year younger than I am, wouldn’t get tested. He’s since had some issues that have been controlled. Tonight, my father told me that a tumor was discovered in my cousin’s brain and he’ll need radiation. I’m just writing  because I need something to do with my emotions: anger at cancer, anger at a stupid gene that has robbed our family, anger at my cousin for not taking preventative steps, scared we’re going to lose another person, upset it’s hitting my generation."

I have had a messy background, and for quite some time a very secular life, although I was born to a Jewish mother. I have slowly been dipping my feet in religious life and trying to get involved with Jewish community. I attended a conservative service and bar mitzvah a while back, spoken with an orthodox rabbi, and I am now reaching out to a reform rabbi. I expect that reform will probably be right for me, as I think these ideals may align more with mine. I know that reform isn’t nearly as strict as conservative or orthodox, and they can be more lenient with certain situations, but I want to eventually keep shabbat every week and be observant.

I just got hired for a new job (I can’t say where for obvious reasons). And I filled in my availability earlier on in the application process. Now, I have been searching for a job for the past three months with no success. It has been rejection after rejection. When things actually looked good for this job I didn’t want to do anything that might compromise it. I’m a college student and I also have quite a bit of medical debt so I desperately need a source of income. I knew that once I found a shul that was right for me I would want to attend morning shabbat service, but most places want you working on the weekend to even consider hiring you. So, I put my availability for Saturday as after 1pm, so that I would at least be able to attend services. In the notes I just put, “Willing to work Saturday afternoons and nights, but would prefer to have Saturday off.” I was hopeful. I at least felt hopeful that I wouldn’t have to go into work before 1pm.

I got part of my schedule today and it looks like for Saturdays I will be scheduled at 11am. They couldn’t even bother to at least push it back two hours. I at least got Friday evenings off but I don’t know how to feel. Being secular I never really dealt with this before, but I suppose I should have expected it. I guess I’m okay with it until I can find a shul to start regularly attending and I become observant… I still don’t like it, and I don’t want it to be a regular thing with this job. But I need this job. I’m a bit nervous to bring this up my first day but I still will. I know it could be a genuine mistake, might be hard to make adjustments for shifts… but I offered to give them half of my Saturday even when I know I shouldn’t, and they still couldn’t make my request. I suppose when I set up a meeting with this rabbi this will be a good thing to discuss. I need money. I need a job. But I also want to be observant."

Irl I'm expected to have moved on by now, after all I have other friends, family so they say but anyone who ever lost someone in any capacity knows that you can't really replace people.

I have a very dear and beloved friend, someone that is like a sibbbing to me, someone I have unconditional love for, someone whose friendship is everything to me, someone with whom I shared everything, someone with whom I had conversations in silence because just looking at each other we knew what the other was thinking. 

This dear and beloved friend decided that yiddishkeit was no longer their path, I understood their reasons and their choice, never once pushed for them to remain frum or tried to convince them of anything, I was just there for them. Once they left frumkeit they cut contact with everyone they knew, this included me and I have tried to understand their reasons, I have not heard from them in almost two years, during this time I reached out only twice, trying to be respectful of their choice, given them space etc They changed all their contact information so I'm no longer able to reach out even if I want to. 

I wish I could describe the grief, pain and anguish I have been going through over the loss of my dear friend, it feels like a death and I'm not able to move forward, to have any closure. I have gone through several other losses and tragedies like I have posted here and I wish I could tell my dear friend about it like I used to, lean on them like I used to, hear their words of wisdom, advice, their silly jokes but mostly that silence that told me everything I needed to know without words. To make things worse I have heard from their family that they know they struggling with addiction, possibly mental illness and I want to reach out but don't even have how. 

Tonight the pain of their absence is crushing, I miss them so much, I feel I can barely breath. I'm not sure what I hope with this post, tonight just feels so unberable, I would just give everything for one more conversation with my dear friend."

I’m not a Jew but I’m a Muslim and I’m reading the Bible and I wanted y’all’s interpretation of something in Psalms.

The verse in question is Psalms 110:1:

The LORD says to my Lord: ""Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.

A trinitarian came up to me an argued that since it’s two lords talking it’s about the trinity and plurality within God.

I responded by saying that the Hebrew word for The LORD and the second my Lord are different one is the Tetragrammaton the other can be used for a human being.

He proceeds to then tell me that the difference in the two word was only a later addition in the Torah and that in  the Isaiah scrolls one of the oldest copies of psalms is ""my god says to my god or “my
lord say to my lord"" 

So he says that the yhwh was a later addition and that both of them should say Adoni

He’s now arguing that since there is no distinction made between the Adonis that it’s two yhwhs speaking to eachother like the trinity.

Can I get y’all’s input on these claims since it’s also y’all’s scripture"

I’ll preface this by saying that I have anticipated some of the responses this post will receive, but regardless I’m eager to read what you all think!

As the title indicates, I’m wondering what you, Israelis, might think about Al-Jazeera? Their reporting of the conflicts, intifadas, more recently the Jenin Raid, and how generally they’re viewed by an Israeli? How biased, if at all? Where are they right and wrong? I have read even members of Palestinian factions are unfavourable toward them. 

So far as I’m aware they’re just a propaganda organization who’s main objective is to give reporting that favours Arabic factions, causes, and movements, versus giving impartial reporting. They tend to present anything to do with Israel, in a way that will always negatively depict Israel and Israelis, and have on numerous occasions engaged in anti-Israel, Anti-Jewish, and anti-American rhetoric. 

I understand many in this sub, like myself, am not Israeli, and so I will extend an invitation to those non-Israelis to give their input and insight and opinions.  Look forward to the responses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gkq1lu42u1fb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a98c611aa4724c66b72864c26996219b1e6fd3b7

*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today’s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*

Even the simplest biological organisms use logic. For example, when an antelope hears a rustling in the grass, it will start to flee. The antelope follows a logical ""if... then..."" rule. Those antelopes that did not develop the biology that encodes this logic were eaten a long time ago and did not reproduce. However, there is no need to look for such sophisticated examples. If the sun shines on one side of a flower, it will grow in that direction. Even the simple single-celled amoeba can follow the logic that says if there is a nutrient gradient, then start wiggling protrusions to swim in that direction.

Humans have always used such logic, but once we could speak, we learned to formulate explicit ""if... then..."" statements. At some later stage in human civilization, we started studying the process of logic itself. The systematic study of logic achieved results that human intuitive logic often confuses. For example, there is a difference between saying, ""I will eat an apple if it is red"" and saying, ""I will only eat an apple if it is red."" The latter is called the bidirectional conditional or ""if and only if"" (sometimes abbreviated as ""iff""). Using the bidirectional form implies that if I am eating an apple, it must be red. On the other hand, using the simpler form does not prove that the apple is red. It is easy to trip people up, make them look dumb, and give yourself the feeling that you must be smart, by posing your friends puzzles that depend on this distinction.

We can use our power to process words to work carefully through symbolic or numeric logic. However, this process is slow. If we guess or use our intuition, we can significantly speed up the process, which will often succeed in simple uncontrived cases.

Our intuition is good and fast because our brains are made up of a vast amount of logic circuits, but these circuits specialize in correlation. While learning that A comes along with B seems like logic, correlation is not the same as symbolic logic. Correlation is fast, while logic processing is slow.

We invented computers to run through the careful and accurate process of numeric and symbolic logic billions of times faster than we can. Eventually, this process came full circle as we learned how to build computers that can emulate the biological circuits so effective at finding correlations.

Why would we want to do that? Firstly, because correlation systems are very good at learning and adapting. Secondly, logical problems, when applied to large systems with many moving parts, quickly require more computations than there are atoms in the universe.

Correlation is better for learning and handling complexity, but it requires misleading simplifications and is very prone to errors.

The modern human is stuck between correlation and logic. Starting a few hundred years ago, our scientists did so well using logic that we thought it could be applied everywhere. But it doesn't work that way. As scientists threatened to become the only elite worth listening to, every other elite assumed they could use the same tricks. Today, some leading scientists speak about non-scientific subjects unaware that they are not using the tools for which they have been given so much credit. They imagine that it is their cognitive superiority that makes them so capable, but it is just the choice of subject matter.

Our simplistic intuitive ""logic"" is not able to master the challenges created by our large societies or the planet-destroying power that we now have. However, it is not possible to marshal the computational power for rigorous logic to make these decisions, as even much simpler puzzles are rigorously solvable only in theory.

Not all is lost. The fact that we cannot guarantee solutions does not mean we cannot make success a little more likely. If we develop more empathy and increase our ability to think rationally on a global level, we may yet have a chance."

I’m asking this question, because the politics of this sub seem largely liberal/centrist and anti-judicial coup. Observed from the outside, it is quite clear that the anti-democratic / pro-coup forces within Israel are a direct outgrowth of Israel’s continuing occupation of the West Bank. After all, a government that denies Palestinians a say in how their daily lives are governed would inevitably come after other political enemies next: LGBT people, women, secular Jews, leftists, and so forth. 

So my question is this: if you consider yourself a part of the anti-judicial coup camp, how do you live with the tension of maintaining a military occupation that denies self-determination to 2.5 million Palestinians? Are you campaigning to end the occupation? 

And before you say “well, the second intifada” yes, I do understand the role it played in all but destroying the peace movement within Israel. But the occupation existed for 30 years before the second intifada and has persisted for another 20 after the second intifada. 

Same goes for the disengagement. Yes, I understand the hesitancy for a unilateral pullout from the occupied territories given Israel’s experience in Gaza, but again, what does this have to do with the continued entrenchment and expansion of settlements in the West Bank that are designed to destroy the possibility of a future Palestinian state? 

To borrow from Abba Eban, the fact that the Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity is not an excuse to miss all subsequent opportunities. 

I hope more of my Israeli friends in the anti-coup camp begin to see the clear connection between the attack on democracy within Israel and the occupation happening next door, and fight with the same kind of passion to end it. 

I look forward to hearing your thoughts."

In addition to making peace with Israel, Saudi Arabia would as well provide massive economic aid to the Palestinians to wean them off Israeli dependency provided Palestine would endorse the treaty too. Direct negotiations between Palestine and Israel could then recommence based on the Oslo paradigm under the auspices of the USA and KSA with a high probability of success since Israel has stopped settling and the Palestinians have realized its not 1917 anymore.  

I like the chances of success here. A perfect storm if you will where everybody wins. The US solidifies itself above China in the Middle East for decades to come and creates a NATO-style allience against Iran. Saudi Arabia gets a home run by being the one who finally solved the Palestinian problem thereby taking away Iran's reason detre and gets to wave its peaceful nuclear program in Iran's face with the full backing of US military might behind it,  probably contibuting to the downfall or shift of the Iranian regime toward a similar peace involving recognition of Israel in the decades to come. Israel gets to keep most or all territory it's gained and settled since 1948, washes its hands of the Palestinians, and absolves itself before the the ICJ and ICC (Israel claims it doesnt care but in reality is not interested at all in going down that rout). The occupation is a ticking time bomb for Israel And the Palestinians get all of the conditions they've been asking for to return to the negotiating table with Israel handed to them i.e. halt to settlement building, no retroactive settlement legalization, transfer of most of area C to them, and a promise by Israel never to annex the West Bank - ever - all guaranteed by the USA. The stick is revomed. They also get aids carrot from Saudi Arabia and/or USA. It all seems to work.

Word is that the aging Saudi King Salman is personally involved in negotiations with the Americans, which demonstrates seriousness, and that Israeli leaders are receiving constant updates on progress but haven't commented yet. Netanyahu would surely need a national unity government to pass it since with his current coalition its a no go. The Palestinians for their part are already in talks on a unity government, which would require Hamas to sign on to the Abbas endorsement of the plan, if it happens, and he does...

Does Biden have chance at pushing this through? What are the reasons it can or can't work?"

When an artist as big as Christina cancels a scheduled performance, it can break through the news cycle in a way that can be very hard for another kind of solidarity action.

It was me, turns out, I really was jewish, my mother explained that we were of Sepharadic descent and test showed it also plus the fact that my mother kept some family minhagim.

Also, that some story of forced marriage happened a few generations ago, an arab Sheir married my ancestor on my matrilineal side and the descended had Islam as religion.

So what I did was to come to Israel on a turist visa, explain everything, started going to a Haredi yeshiva did a so called Gyur Lechumra, showed up in front of the Beit Din (in Mea Shearim) three time and got tested twice (i failed the first time, they where very scary). So they ultimately accepted me, shecked my pp, said it was kosher, then I whent to the Mikveh, but just before diving they took a bit of blood, made my dive and said no bracha.

Btw I have to say that contrary to most gerim I was Chayav leMitzvos, I put on tefillin, and actually my first pair of teffilin were passul so my Rav bought me new one (He is a great man), also I did shabbat without melacha, I had my tallith katan on me and went outside just in case.

That's how I got a Haredi gyur from one of the hardest beit din of Israel, I saw the beit din first time ever 2 weeks before Purim (they asked about the matsav ext) had my first test one week before Shavot and got out of the mikveh for good in the middle of Tishrey. Since it was a month of Ben Asmanim I got it done pretty quickely.

So yeah, to the haters of yesterday, Hashem was with me in the end wasn't Him?"

So I am not Jewish, and I work in a place where I constantly interact with the public. Part of my job requires me to touch and adjust safety equitment that is being worn. Today a family came in and the oldest boy requested that he put his own equiptment  on (I would guess he was about 14). For context all the male members had payot and yarmulke's on.

 I am not massively familiar with all the jewish teachings and communities. I had guesses at the time that he did not want to be touched due to being an 'of age' male. My male co-worker was happilly accepted to help instead. 

I have tried researching but I am getting alot of information which dosn't truly answer my questions. I am aware of Negiah but I am not sure if that is applicable across all communities. I'm just looking for a simple answer: 

Do all Jewish males abide by the rule of not being touched by anyone who is not male, is this the same for females, is it only in certain areas, and what age does this rule apply? 

I am only asking so I can be more knowledgable and thus considerate in the future expecially at work.

It was a six point star, point up, with a horseshoe directly below it, with the tops of the “u” touching the star bottom point.  Sorta like a modem dovid with a nose ring.

I went in and asked the employees if they knew what it meant, and the none of them seemed to know.  

Have you heard of this symbol?"

Were they formed due to some differences in how each practiced Halacha?

Was there opposition to grouping Jews in this way?"

I picked some freshgrown blueberries and wanted to make her a simple blueberry syrup/jam. I'm unsure if it is possible though, as I am not Jewish and I do not have kosher cookware. Is it possible for me to make my cookware kosher so I can gift her this item or is it too much trouble as a non-Jewish person?"
