# ISRAEL-PALESTINE NLP PROJECT

*Description:*
The intended aim of this project was to study the evolution of discourse online during the Israel-Palestine conflict through the analysis of 
three subreddits: r/Israel (Pro-Israel), r/Palestine (Pro-Palestine), r/IsraelPalestine (Neutral); various natural language processing techniques were
exploited to gather insights from these communities.


*Contents:*
- RoBerta Classifier for political stance of reddit posts.
- BERT-topic implementation for topic modeling across Pro-Palestine vs Pro-Israel Subreddits.
- Implementation of transformer LLM for emotion classification through time.

  The Reddit Textual data was collected using the Academic Torrents platform. For further information refer to the creator of the base datasets: @watchful1.
